I find that there\'s too much to me to break it down into one category and it feels odd to focus on any one aspect.  I may draw furries, or Japanese art styles, or certain fandoms, or be into medieval weapons or dragons or motorcycles or whatever, but just because none of those alone really define me as a person, I don\'t really feel like part of any of those or any other communities.\r\n\r\nEch... normally, I make more sense.  The short answer is I don\'t feel like I really belong in any specific group.

(217,45,2,'The Weekly Challenge FAQ/Info','[b][size=14]The Weekly Challenge![/size][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]What is the Weekly Challenge?[/b]\r\nThe Weekly Challenge is our attempt at helping artist to break out of the rut.  Most artists get into one; drawing the same kinds of images over and over, be they static images of a lone character with no background, or the same character over and over, or whatnot.  We try to break this rut by giving weekly \"assignments\" that might seem out of the ordinary, or might make you think.\r\n\r\n[b]Okay.  Sounds interesting.  When does it happen?[/b]\r\nAll week long.  We try to post one each week.  But, sometimes Real Life can step in the way.  So, when we post them, you have a week to complete the assignment.  Details will be posted with each assignment, including dates and such.\r\n\r\n[b]How do I participate?[/b]\r\nWhen a new challenge is posted, read it, and do the assignment.  When you\'re done with your assignment, reply to the thread here, and post your image in it with the image BBCode tag, or a direct link to the image using the link BBCode tag.\r\n[code]Examples:\r\n[img]http://url.to.your/image.jpg[/img]\r\n[url]http://url.to.your/image.jpg[/url][/code]\r\n\r\n[b]Wait, it\'s only one week.  I don\'t know if I can complete a full image in that time![/b]\r\nNo worries.  The object isn\'t to have a fully completed masterpiece bu the end of the week.  It\'s to have a presentable work that fits the goals of the Weekly Challenge.  However, we [u]do not[/u] want rough sketches, scribbles, or doodles.  Please, put at least [i]some[/i] effort into it.\r\n\r\n[b]Are there any prizes?[/b]\r\nNot for the Weekly Challenges, no.  This is more to exercise your skills as an artist.\r\n\r\n[b]Can I comment on or critique other people\'s submissions?[/b]\r\nMost definitely!  We allow and highly encourage participants to comment on and critique each other\'s work.  It\'s how we learn.  However, we ask that those who are giving critiques do so in the most respectful manner possible, and those who are receiving critiques recognise them for what they are: helpful suggestions on how to improve!  [b]Drama-makers will be excused from all subsequent challenges, and possibly banned from the forums.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]What is the typical schedule for the Weekly Challenges?[/b]\r\nTypically, a new challenge will be posted on Sunday.  Submissions are due by the following Saturday.  Comments and critiques are welcome during any point in the challenge, or after.\r\n\r\n[b]Am I restricted in the kinds of media I can use?[/b]\r\nAbsolutely not!  Get creative!\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2006-09-14 00:43:22','2006-09-21 20:24:54',2,'69.3.86.30 - Fairfax-fw.pccc.com',NULL),

To get attention?  :p  I know that\'s what I\'M doing with one of MY projects!  XD  The second one.  Not the third one.  [COUGH]  What?\r\n\r\nMoving on...\r\n\r\nI have a TON of projects...  Of course, I have so many, nothing useful ever gets done with any of them...  But if I don\'t keep adding projects... I feel like I\'m wasting away..  And yet..  I still never really get anything done.. ^^;;;;;;;;;;\r\n\r\n1.  Art.  I SHOULD be doing a Mario piece.  I keep saying I\'m going to do it next.  I\'ve been MEANING to do it since I was waiting for New Mario to come out...  Instead...  Trying to force myself to finish an extremely late gift picture from someone that I\'ve been dragging my feet on because it involves Satoshi Urushihara and...  Well...  His skill is quite intimidating...  ^^;;;;;;;;;;;\r\n\r\n2.  Secret Manga Project.  I\'ve been working on this for...  God... How long has it been now?  Probably 3-4 years now.  The script\'s been rewritten more times than I can count and all I\'ve really done is draw the first issue.  Which ... Was actually finished years ago...  But I\'ve been dragging my feet on pushing it through Photoshop and stuff...  As of last week, it\'s all Photoshopped and ready...  Except... At the last second, I realized, I never made a logo to stick on the cover art... >_<  And now I\'m being lazy about that... ^^;;;;;;;;;;;;;  As to what it\'s about and stuff...  I\'m not saying.  That\'s why it\'s a secret.  And only three people in the whole world know ANYTHING of it and its contents.  And while I\'m sure it\'ll use a standard set of cliches and such, I will only say that it is indeed HIGHLY different from all the other manga currently available in stores and online.  Well... I can\'t promise that it\'ll be completely unlike anything you\'ve ever read...  But at least the setting, story, and genre are different.  :p  No comment on those, though.  :p\r\n\r\n3.  Experimental Game Project #2 - Tetris Clone.  Ever since I was little, I was always fascinated with video games and always wanted to make my own.  I can\'t tell you how many agonizing hours I wasted in Elementary School, pouring over the BASIC manual for my Tandy Color Computer 3...  Of course, I never got anywhere...  Not even in college, while I was getting straight As in my C++ classes... For some reason, I was never quite able to understand how to even begin to go about planning a game program.  I\'ll spare you the sob story (unless you really want to hear it, but it\'s really quite long.  :p), but it wasn\'t until a few years ago that I finally was able to write my first game.  Tic-Tac-Toe.  Yes, I know.  Child\'s play for a pro.  But for me... Well... Let\'s just say I\'m... \"Differently Abled\" as Peter Griffin would put it and ... Leave it at that.  :p  It took about a year and a port to QBASIC from Microsoft Visual C++ 6, after our Windows 95 committed ritual suicide one fine morn, to get it done to where I was happy with it.  From there...  I set my sights on something far more challenging...  Tetris.  Taking everything I learned in Tic-Tac-Toe and applying it to Pajitnov\'s classic took some work but... After two years of hair pulling and screaming at my monitor...  The program\'s almost done.   And the only time I ever need to ask for help was when I couldn\'t get pieces to fall faster than once per second.  A kind person on a QBASIC board provided me with a neat algorhythem which handled the problem in a way I would never had thought of.  ^^ And as of this writing, it\'s really almost done.  Technically, you can sit down and play a full game of Tetris on it already!  ^^  The only sticking point is that I don\'t have a Game Over routine yet so it keeps playing on into infinity, even if you\'ve filled your way to the top of the board.  ^^;;;; I need to do that one of these days.  Plus I want to add a High Score thingy (which will be the first excercise in file opening and writing that I\'ve done in...  ...  Uh...  5-6 years?) and of course...  The ol\' Title Screen.  Can\'t get away without having one of those!  XD  Of course, I\'ve been thinking past Tetris for a least two years now...  I have several game ideas I\'ve been brainstorming.  I want to do an original puzzle game, based on my Tetris engine but I really need to sit down with those ideas and some paper and scissors and figure out if it\'s any fun or not first.  :p  I\'ve also been toying with the idea of having my third experimental project being a clone of the first stage of Super Robot Wars 2 (since it\'s the only game in the series where I\'ve actually been able, with the help of a friend, to divine how the game calculates damage and stuff), as the basis a Strategy/RPG engine for another couple of original game ideas I\'ve had (plus, I been wanting to do a fan game for a while with series that have never and may never be in the series....  XD XD XD XD XD).  But all that\'s in the distant future...  Distant.  Who knows...  -_-;;;;;;\r\n\r\nWow.  That was ten times longer than Grin\'s story...  ^^;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\r\n\r\n4.  Super Robot Wars 2 - ROM Translation.  Yes, yes, I know.  The subject of ROMs and emulators and such creates many, many flame wars on message boards and such but...  I ...  I really don\'t care.  An English Robot Wars game is the dream of many, many people... Though, maybe not enough people.  [COUGH]  A dream that was realized a couple months ago by the good people of Atlus with the release of Super Robot Taisen (bleh. Even Banpresto\'s own 15th Anniversary logo says Robot WARS):  Original Generation.  However, this has been a pet project of mine for more years than I can count.  And before you ask...  I know exactly 90% less Japanese than YOU do.  :p  At this point, it\'s just as much a learning excercise in Japanese for me (before you ask, my school won\'t or rather CAN\'T teach Japanese because there are no qualified instructors available.  I\'ve bugged them about it a lot) as it is a labor of love for the series.  However...  Given this information... You should probably know that in all these years...  I\'ve only recently been able to move on to Mission 2.  XD  Blame slang for that.  :p  And the fact that I discovered a secret part to the first mission that makes it longer.  And that I get stuck a lot and have to depend on those that do know it better than I which makes me feel guilty and I end up not asking them for help for long periods of time, even though I can\'t move any further without it.  >_<  \r\n\r\n5.  Webpage Redesign and Launch.  I used to have a page.  It was called MECHAnical Endeavors.  It was on a free site.  Then the site took the freeness away.  And I had no money to pay for the site.  And I didn\'t want to tear out 2/3rds of my site to make it family friendly for GeoCities, which my site had escaped from a few years earlier.  And since.  I\'ve been without a page.  I have to link my Side 7 gallery because that\'s all I really have.  Now that I have a job, paying for a site may actually be feasible, however, I don\'t want to put back up the ugly old HTML from before.  But...  .....................................  I have NO idea what to make it LOOK like!  ;_;  And so... This remains an open project.  To be completed.  Someday.\r\n\r\nLast..  And almost certainly least...\r\n\r\n6.  The Weekly Comic.  I....  Uh... I don\'t want to say too much about it.  Mainly because...  Well... ^^;;;;;;;;;  Let\'s just say...  In today\'s gaming world...  It\'s not exactly... \"PC\"  By which I mean Politically Correct.  ... Pun not intended.  I have nothing against PCs or PC gamers.  [COUGH]  As such, I won\'t post links and stuff...  But it\'s been going on almost ... Probably 5-6 now...  Or rather... It was started 5-6 years ago.  And I used to post new strips on time every Monday.  Sometimes, I worked so hard, that I might actually be a couple strips ahead of schedule!  And while it never got more than a maybe a hundred visitors at a time, if even that, I was still happy with it.  Alas...  Things began to go down hill when I joined the work force....  Creativity and energy began to drop and I was finding it harder and harder to deliver strips on time.  Eventually... I began to miss weeks.  Than months.  When I got a tablet and could draw stuff instantly without having to go through the tidium of scanning, I honestly thought I would start to really put some good work behind the strip but...  Well..  It\'s gotten to the point where I ... I need to get back into it...  But everytime I try...It feels like I\'m doing a chore I don\'t want to do.  Even IF I have a good idea.  I just don\'t seem to have the will anymore.  This past E3, I really thought I could get back into the swing of things but... In the end... I couldn\'t do more than post past the first day....  It remains an open project because I don\'t want to give up...  But I seem to have hit a wall that I just can\'t get past.  :(\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nDang.

I\'ve been working on it since late 1993.  I\'m very close to having it finished, and ready to send to a printer.  I\'m actually working on starting a gaming company, as I\'ve got 5 expansion books in the works for the game, 2 other role playing games, and a card game, all either on the drawing boards or in the planning stages.\r\n\r\nHere\'s my schpiel on my current game:\r\n\r\n[quote][b][i]Stellar Chaos[/i][/b] is a table-top role playing game, set in the not-so-distant future against a science fiction backdrop. It\'s heavily influenced by both Japanese animation and American classic sci-fi.\r\n\r\nThe playing environment surrounds Earth\'s numerous colonial worlds, who have suspiciously lost contact with Earth, and therefore have banded together into Nation States to survive and share/hoard resources. Expeditions back to Earth to discover the source of the loss of communications have never returned, therefore Earth is unanimously declared off-limits until further notice.\r\n\r\nThe playing system is a system of opposed rolls (i.e. skill vs skill or attacker vs defender), based very much in real-world science and physics. It boasts both a detailed, \"normal\" system for those who wish to play as real as possible, and the Point Blank system, designed to introduce novices, and for use to streamline and up-pace the action.\r\n\r\nThe primary overall story is broad and open-ended, officially ending at Present Day, so that Game Masters may mold the universe\'s continuing story to their liking. Likewise, the game system is scalable so that adventures and campaigns may be as modest or as grand as the Game Master would like it to be. (It\'s been tested in both deep-space, ship-to-ship campaigns, and small-scale, police story-type games.)\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I really can\'t go into detail. Or, more accurately, I\'m not coming up with anything else describably at the moment. Hm... but it does look like I\'m starting to become a Sales Droid.

Or, \"older\", anyway.  :p  Since he doesn\'t fly anymore maybe he\'s on medication to reduce his blood pressure or something.  There\'s also the fact that in 64, Fox was still young and Peppy probably felt he had to yell to get his point across.  Two games later, Fox probably doesn\'t need such babysitting anymore.\r\n\r\n:I dunno.

Let alone someone you\'ve never met in person). \r\nI also don\'t think that minors should be allowed to post there (or at least people under the age of 16 or so). A large part of it is unofficially functioning as a hookup site, which is dangerous for anyone (not minors in particular). However, I think that it is the ethical (and certainly legal) responsibility for the web admins to recognize that, and to do more to keep minors out of that scene. Not as a patronizing \"you\'re too young to understand what\'s good for you\" type thing, but just because it\'s the right thing to do :P.

Incidentally, that was similar to the image that jumped into my head when I read the challenge, though more interesting.\r\n\r\nI never actually participated in the weekly challenge before - though I tried once - but what turned me off was the statement in the rules that, \"rough sketches\" weren\'t allowed.  I think I understand what was meant by that, but it did give me the impression of polished, and that wasn\'t what I got out of the weekly challenge before and is just too much work for me to put into a random drawing, especially one done only for fun.  Also, this week\'s challenge was at its core a bit time-consuming, given that we were supposed to depict an entire scene.  Simple little sketches I can do, but I have so many projects going on and other ideas in my head that I just don\'t have the time for something so large, even if it only goes so far. (And I have the sometimes annoying tendency to insist on finishing anything that comes out remotely well.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, just thought I\'d give another perspective as to lack of participation.  Personally, I would omit the line in the rules about quality of submitted work, or at least alter it to sound more user-friendly, e.g., \"No, it doesn\'t have to be a fully finished picture, but we\'re not looking for stick figures here.\"  Highly unprofessional sounding, but I just woke up.',0,'2006-09-30 09:47:35','2006-09-30 09:47:35',0,'74.12.7.165',NULL),

One day in pre-alg. I just started writing a crazy off the wall story about the LOTR characters, and thus, it began. We wrote LOTR parodies for 4 years, to make a total number of over 100 pages of complete nonsence. \r\n\r\nyou will need to know the following characters:\r\nLego (legolas) - a complete idiotic elf who has a pet monkey named Pretzels\r\nPreztels - the idiot pet monkey that I (LG) will kill one way or another\r\nLG (L greenleaf)- myself, I live with Lego and pretzals, and completely hate the monkey\r\n\r\nNONE OF THIS is made to be taken seriously, it is full of gramatical and spelling errors, please do not bash me on how stupid this is and how its horrible. THATS THE POINT! This is only to give people somthing to read if they feel like it :D\r\n\r\n(the story is told from my point of view)\r\n\r\nEnjoy:\r\n[u]LG\'s Game Show[/u]\r\nWell today I felt like torturing pretzels and lego, so I shoved them in their carseats, making sure I suffocated both of them, and After breaking the speed limit, driving on the wrong side of the road, getting in 7 car crashes, and getting 1,000,021 tickets, we finally made it to the place where I would make my game show, “The wheel of torture” (oh joy ^_^). This is how the game works: you grab either lego or pretzels, tie them down to a spinning wheel that has an eleven health association warning sticker on it ( it has to have nails, spikes, etc. sticking out of it). Then spin it, and whichever color the spinner stops on is the torture to be preformed on the elf, hobbit, demon, etc. tied to the wheel. Today’s torture was to be preformed on pretzel. The spinner landed on black and so he had to watch sixteen hours of the AMC (anti-monkey-channel) while eating exploding elf crackers. Well since everybody loved my game show, I made several episodes and tortured pretzels on every one of them. When I tried to put lego on the wheel, the elf king came, arrested me, and blew up my studio, so we all died and no one cared anymore. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',0,'2006-09-30 22:54:46','2006-09-30 22:56:56',2,'74.237.141.35 - adsl-074-237-141-035.sip.gsp.bellsouth.net',NULL),

(735,83,2,'Development of Side 7 v4.0 Re-starts','Greetings Ladies and Gents.\r\n\r\nI know many people are wondering what\'s going on with Side 7.  Please allow me to fill you in.\r\n\r\nCoding for v4.0 has restarted.  The forums was the beginning of that effort, and development of the forums [url=http://mb.side7.com/thread.cgim?forum_thread_id=4&forum_category_id=3&inc=1]continues[/url].  That being said, the forums is only the first step, and its continued development will be brought inline with Side 7\'s new codebase.\r\n\r\n This is an entirely new codebase.  No code from the current site is being reused as it has become completely unscalable and inflexible, and that has seriously hampered updating and upgrading the code along a normal upgrade path.  So, we\'re going with a brand new codebase.  This is the third time we\'ve done this, and it\'s proven to be better each time, as well, as to teach us many new things.\r\n\r\nVersion 4.0 of Side 7 has a new feature list that is twice as long as the current feature list.  There will be a significant number of art categories added to the site, as well as new portfolios for Favourites, Art Trades, Serial Art, and more.\r\n\r\nAccount Credits will become usable in a large number of ways, and won\'t simply be stagnant in your accounts anymore.\r\n\r\nWe have brought on a number of new people who are fullfilling a number of roles on the site, meaning that there is more than just my head and hands in the game.  These people have volunteered their time to help with trouble tickets, moderating, and more.  As the tools they need are brought online, you\'ll see more and more of their presence on the site.  Please respect those people, as they represent the administration of Side 7 and carry with them that authority.\r\n\r\nMuch more of the account administration will be automated so that site members have greater control over their accounts without the need for admin intervention.  This will put a greater amount of responsibility on the individual members to keep their account login information private.  We\'ve spent a lot of time working on security for the new site, including its login system, to minimise any ability to harvest passwords, forge logins, or crack into an account.  We believe that the new security is strong enough to give members more severe account tools, such as \"Remove My Account\".\r\n\r\nI\'m sure many of you have seen what\'s coming up on Side 7, but just in case, I\'ll post it here:\r\n\r\n[b]Changes to Entire Site:[/b]\r\n[list][*]Modification of layout code to better facilitate site skins.\r\n[*]Update numerous places where additional sorting should be.\r\n[*]Addition of Site Skins.\r\n[*]Improved Username visibility site-wide.\r\n[*]Random Image button on main page.\r\n[*]Complete redesign of main page.\r\n[*]Removal of splash page.\r\n[*]New Announcements Mailing List.\r\n[*]Improved login system.\r\n[*]Referral rewards system.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Changes to Account System:[/b]\r\n[list][*]Merge First/Last Name records into one \"Public Name\" field.\r\n[*]Addition of Account Avatars\r\n[*]Login notification of new additions in your Museum since your last visit/login.\r\n[*]Fully automate the Account Upgrade system.\r\n[*]Fully automate the Account Application and Approval system.\r\n[*]Fully automate the Account Removal system.\r\n[*]Add Visitor -> Basic Account upgrade ability.\r\n[*]New uses for Account Credits: AotD showings, Additional Avatars, Additional Uploads.\r\n[*]The ability to give Account Credits to other site members.\r\n[*]A realignment of the Account Types so that they are easier to understand.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Changes to Biography System:[/b]\r\n[list][*]Addition of Commission Rates Listing System.\r\n[*]Addition of member Commenting Rules: member defined requests for commenting (i.e. \"no cutesie comments, only serious critiques\")\r\n[*]The possibility of a minor journaling system, [i][u]but this is still in debate[/u][/i].

(804,89,6055,'','Digital media will never threaten traditional. That’s like saying colored pencil is threatening oil paints because you can create something of the same effect with them and the people who do call it \"colored pencil painting\". Photoshop, painter, etc are just tools and like anything else can’t give you talent. You can \"cheat\" with any media, and like anything else \"cheating\" with digital media (using filters, etc) leads to a persons work looking cheap 9 times out of 10.\r\nI think a lot of people who harp on digital artists don’t really understand what it means to do a digital painting or drawing. I’ve heard a lot of people saying \"you just click a button and you have a masterpiece\". On the contrary, its actually much more difficult to achieve convincing texture and so forth with digital media because you really have to rely on your own observation and knowledge of color and light to do so as you are working in a strictly 2 dimensional media. Yes a person can use filters to create texture, but a person can use stencils and paint splatters to create texture on paper or canvas just as quickly and easily. And as I said before, both generally come off looking sort of cheap. Yes, a person can get brilliant colors easily with digital media whereas other media (oils, watercolors, etc) can get muddy. Every media has its strengths and weaknesses. A person should always consider what is best for a piece and accept that what may be good for some kinds of work may not be good for others.\r\n\r\nIn short, nothing will ever replace hard work and good ideas. Computers are only tools, not brains and hands. A computer can’t create art, much the same as a computer cant make a person’s art better.

This gets rid of any remaining mold release agent, grime, skin oils, and dirt.  A good detergent should be sufficient.  Rinse and let dry.\r\nIf you can do so without damaging the horse (and if it\'s possible), try to disassemble it before you paint it.  This will make handling it while painting much easier.\r\nI\'m guessing acrylics will probably work best because of their low toxicity and easy clean-up.  It\'s probably best to apply a coat of paint as a primer if only to weaken the horse\'s pre-existing color.  Paint your lighter colors first, then work up to your darkest one.  Use as many coats of each color as you need to make it look right; it\'s better to build up your coats than to overdo one.  Apply any highlights and detailing after the main coats are dry.  Once all that is finished, apply a clear coat or two (gloss, flat, semi-gloss, whichever one is best) to protect the paintjob.\r\nIf you really need to, you can get some really, really fine sandpapers from a hobby store so as to polish the paint once each coat has set.

These are real contests, with real, physical prizes.  The contests will happen in a number of rounds, with a final, grand prize round.\r\n\r\nI cannot reveal any major details at the moment, but I can say this:  The grand prize round will be a prize pack worth between $500 and $1000.  What is it?  You\'ll just have to wait.\r\n\r\nNow, here\'s the part where you come in!  Start listening in to [url=http://www.live365.com/stations/s7radio]Side 7 Radio[/url], and get your friends involved.  The above-mentioned contests will require a large audience to pull off.  It\'s hardly a contest if we have only 5 people participating.  And no, in order to win, they do not have to be members of Side 7. :)\r\n\r\nThe contests will be directly tied to the development and release of Side 7 v4, so start listening in now!\r\n\r\nRemember: We have live shows almost every night, so check the station\'s [url=http://www.live365.com/stations/s7radio/schedule]broadcast schedule[/url] and support Side 7 Radio\'s DJs.\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2006-10-20 11:00:35','2006-10-20 11:00:35',0,'69.3.86.30',NULL),

Even though the figure is exaggerated, the legs are still a little short and the groin is a little too far up in comparison to everything else. The shoes should be more visible (band pants aren\'t wide enough to cover a shoe all the way) and the hem of the pant legs should arch a bit over the tops.\r\n\r\nYou might want to look at some real human skulls for basic anatomical information. You would probably benefit a lot from looking at Mexican dia de los muertos/day of the dead paintings/drawings/sculpture as well. The way you stylized the skull reminds me a lot of some of that art :)\r\n\r\n\r\nCenter guy: I think you may be overcompensating for the shortened figure here, everything is moved up--most notably the armpits, shirt hem, and groin. The arms and to a lesser degree legs are also too short (the tips of his fingers should be closer to the middle of his thighs). The same shoe/pants hem issue comes up here as with Skull man.\r\nI marked off where his knees are here as well, just to show why the arms and legs needed to be elongated :)\r\n\r\nBallet gal: Her head is turned, but her body is relatively forward oriented so there should be pretty much a straight line (following her spine) from the center of her collar bones, to the point between her breasts, to her belly button, to the center of her groin. Her collar bones were the only point on this line which were really off. I made a little bust up top to show approximately how everything would line up. Remember the muscle in her neck also. I made it fairly large in my drawing to illustrate how it might look when flexed, but since she\'s a smallish girl it probably wouldn\'t protrude as much. \r\nJust a little note--you made the collar bones connect at the tops of the shoulders, which is really accurate. It\'s like my biggest pet peeve when people make collar bones grow out of the middle of shoulders or become like cancerous lumps right above the breasts xD. Keep that up :D\r\nAnyway, the arms aren\'t bad length-wise, just a little noodly. Remember the tendon which connects the arm to the body and forms the shape of the armpit, and the elbow joint. The fingers are well-placed (very graceful :)) but lack structure. Just remember the bones and proportions of the joints and you\'re golden.\r\nHer breasts begin a bit too high, and her knees start too low. I drew in the basic shape of her body to try to help with that (it\'s always easier to start with a \"naked\" figure--it obviously wouldn\'t need any detailing--and then add clothes on top). It\'s easiest to reference the placement of knees and breasts by where the torso ends. Since you aren\'t doing realistic anatomy you can\'t use head lengths which makes it more difficult. In this case (since her torso is so shortened) it\'s probably easiest to think of the bottom of the groin as a mid-point between the breasts and the knees.\r\nHer legs weren\'t that badly done other than the knee placement. The calves and feet are just a bit too small. Remember to give things a structure under the skin. The calves need a bit of muscle and fat, and the feet need heels. I looked up some pictures of pointe dancer feet and did a sketch beside to show what I mean a little. I wasn\'t sure exactly how you wanted the feet turned so I just made them a less awkward size on the sketch and showed two different orientations to the right. Remember to give her heel bones--that\'s the most important thing in this case I think :)\r\n\r\n\r\nI would recommend learning how muscles and bones work at least a little bit, and how figures are actually proportioned. This kind of stylization is mostly about eyeballing, unfortunately, which takes a good knowledge of how things actually fit together. Do some life studies (it\'s best to work from real people, but photos can also work if you can\'t get into a figure drawing class or get your friends to sit still, hehe) of people with and without clothing on and get some good books on the subject. My favorite figure drawing books are by Giovanni Civardi. Don\'t use books like How to Draw Manga for anatomy. Those books are great for learning to draw anime faces and monsters and such, but if you use them for anatomy you\'ll pick up a lot of bad habits which will hurt you when you try to stylize figures like this :)\r\nBasically, the figure is layers: bones form the structure under muscles and tendons which form the structure under skin which dictates where wrinkles are in whatever clothing goes over the top. Don\'t forget that and you\'ll be fine :)\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that was helpful. I know I talked a lot, haha \r\n',0,'2006-10-28 15:54:05','2006-10-28 15:54:05',0,'141.155.194.72',NULL),

So, now we have three.  :p  The eldest is Mimi, she\'s black, white, and brown, mostly brown.  Ricky, is the next youngest, about two years or so old, he and his sibling appeared on our doorstep one day, as very, VERY tiny kittens and then disappeared a day later.  A month or two afterwards, he turned up in backyard and we KNOW he\'s the same kitten from that pair because we took pictures and he has an unmistakable white spot on his nose which is the same as one of those kittens.  We have no idea what happened to its sibling.  Now, the new one is named Muchi and he\'s bright orange.  Now, he\'s about 4-5 weeks old.  He hasn\'t grown much bigger but his teeth are out and he\'s FINALLY learned how to use a litter box.  Mimi doesn\'t like him at all, much the way she can\'t stand Ricky, but Ricky, strangest of all..  Has grown quite fond of the kitten.  He routinely picks him up and  ferries him around the house and bathes him.  So much so, that we have to make sure the door to the bathroom that we keep the baby in is always tightly shut because Ricky WILL force open the door and go and play with the kitten.\r\n\r\nAside from those three, we have various strays that come to the house regularly.  Two cats out front, one out back, a large toad which we call (Mr. Froggy) who lives in our pond out back and his small family which, get along, surprisingly well with the cat out back.  They all eat the same hard cat food too.  :p  Which the neighborhood birds also eat.  Hell, once we had a blue crab, show up in our backyard and eat the cat food too!  And we don\'t even live near ANY bodies of water (probably a land crab, though from where, I don\'t know since I\'ve never seen land crabs here in Florida before).',0,'2006-10-31 07:15:13','2006-10-31 07:15:13',0,'70.149.26.132 - adsl-149-26-132.mia.bellsouth.net',NULL),

The game is played with 12 plastic cups, and you try to stack them as fast as you can in the following formations 3-6-3, 6-6. 1-10-1. You stack them like triangles (ex: the \"6\" stack has 3 on the bottom, 2 in the middle, and one on top) and you have to stack them up and down each time (and you have to go in order from left to right!) \r\nAs a joke at breakfast yesterday I took the cups from my motel room down in the dining room and started to stack them. I only had 6 cups, and I was only trying to unstack them. \r\nafter watching me for a few minutes, my friends got in on it too, and we were all stealing juice cups from the breakfast buffet. \r\n\r\nI just tried doing the actual formations tonight, and my best time so far is around 45 seconds. Which I think isn\'t that bad for just 2 days of learning :D\r\n\r\nMe and my friends are starting a Speed Stacking club at school, so we can get a free \"competition quality\" set (12  cups, mat, timer, carrying case, etc) We just can\'t find a sponsor yet :\\\r\n\r\nHas anyone else gotten into the recent fad?\r\nwhat\'s your best time?\r\n\r\n:p last week I had seen the speed stacking kit at walmart and laughed at it becuase I couldn\'t see how people would spend $30 on 12 cups, a mat, and a timer. and now its on my christmas list!! lol',0,'2006-11-06 17:10:04','2006-11-06 17:10:04',0,'74.237.141.35 - adsl-074-237-141-035.sip.gsp.bellsouth.net',NULL),

I doubt anyone still follows my old weekly comic which has been very, very spotty the past couple of years due to my job but starting tomorrow, Wednesday, November 8th, the project shall be unveiled on the same page as my regular comic.  Updated daily (which is assured by the fact that the I have over two weeks worth of material that will be uploaded in bulk and automatically published by the server for the coming weeks), the plot will slowly come together.  As for the old web comic, it will still continue, on Mondays, like it\'s supposed to.  It\'ll just be sandwiched between pages of the manga.  \r\n\r\nNow, at this point, you may be asking...

It\'s basically a big science fiction jaunt across the galaxy, time, and even alternate realities. The settings are always changing, and the story is always changing. There\'s plenty of mysteries and secrets also. Originally intended for kids because of the look of it, the stories are complex enough for older viewers as well. I don\'t have an exact date when the webcomic will launch, but Issue #0 will be done early December and Issue #1 SHOULD hit the web by the end of the 2nd quarter of 2007.\r\n\r\nC.A.G.E. is a novel I work on when I get tired of looking at Vagrant Hero for the night. Set in the future after a terrible disaster, the world has lost all record of history before the crisis and now humanity is forced to hide in fortified cities from an increasingly hostile and mutating ecosystem and the creatures it spawns. The story will center around a special forces soldier named Cain Bonham who, on a routine mission, will encounter various people and creatures that will shatter his grip on reality and ultimately lead him on a path to validating his own concept of reality.\r\n\r\nSo yeah.

A lot of the above we had at the same time. However, right now I only have two pets. After a not so happy move I had to give away all the animals I had, except for my cat. : (\r\n\r\n(Would love Lainburt\'s house - Reptiles and amphibians are my favorite. :])\r\n\r\nAnyway, I currently have in my possesion..\r\n\r\nA brown and black striped female tabby cat named Ginger - Who is the only feline who has the grace of a dog..and thinks all humans are required to speak cat! She becomes quite annoyed if she\'s talking to you and you don\'t meow back.\r\n\r\nI also have a baby iguana that was caught on Boca Grande. He looks \'similar\' to a green iguana (the variety the pet store usually carries), but he\'s a much bolder emerald green color and looks a tad different phsyically. So, i\'m not quite sure what species he is (or if it\'s really a he since I don\'t care enough to find out). Might be an adaptation of another species since supposdely there are varieties of iguanas there that exist nowhere else. Anyway, he\'s not liking the cold very much and has been burying himself in the bedding by his heat rock to keep warm. As of yet he remains nameless, but I was pondering \'Dhamon\' as a name for him. : )\r\n\r\n\r\nTabz',0,'2006-11-21 09:05:46','2006-11-21 09:05:46',0,'68.56.199.93 - c-68-56-199-93.hsd1.fl.comcast.net',NULL),

This challenge is open to all Side 7 artists - or heck, anyone who wants to join!\r\n\r\nThe Side 7 Secret Santa picture exchange is a challenge in which participants draw an image of someone else\'s character and receive a picture of their own character in turn.  Everyone who participates will have an assignment and all participants will receive a gift image themselves.  The catch is you won\'t know who\'s drawing your character until you receive the completed image.  That\'s what makes it a \"Secret Santa\" picture exchange!\r\n\r\n[b]Rules:[/b] Once you have agreed to join the Secret Santa exchange, you are committed to drawing a picture for your recipient.  If for some reason you cannot complete the image on time, inform me [b]immediately[/b] so that we can find another artist to complete the exchange for your intended recipient.  As far as I\'m aware, we\'ve had no issues with this in the past, so I don\'t anticipate any this year, either.\r\n\r\nThe image you draw can be Christmas or winter-themed or not, it\'s entirely your decision.  You may of course include more than one of your recipient\'s characters or you may include a character of your own, but your recipient\'s character(s) must be the dominant subject of the picture.  Your image does not need to be a huge, amazingly detailed masterpiece, but do please refrain from stopping at a quick scribble.  You are welcome to draw and send more than one image to your recipient, if you desire, as long as at least one of the images meets these requirements.\r\n\r\nWhen you receive your assignment, you\'ll be provided with a link to your recipient\'s gallery and/or character information.  If you don\'t receive specific character information, please take a little time to go through your recipient\'s gallery to find a suitable character to draw.  If the recipient doesn\'t have any characters as such, try to find a common theme in their art that you can draw, i.e. fanart of a specific series/medium.  If you need any help trying to figure out what to draw for your recipient, feel free to contact me and I\'ll try to help.\r\n\r\nYou can send your completed image to your recipient as soon as you finish it or you can wait \'til a certain point or wait for Christmas day.  As long as the picture gets to them by then, it\'s up to you.\r\n\r\n[b]Time frame:[/b] Signup for the picture exchange begins upon submission of this post.  I will assign receiving artists to participants by way of random selection on Friday, December 1st.  Once you receive your assignment, you may start drawing.  Images must be sent to recipients by [b]December 25th[/b].  If you don\'t receive your picture by then, contact me and I\'ll find out what\'s going on.  If your image is a little delayed, but you will still complete it, contact me or your recipient directly to let them know.  I do ask that you try to get your image done on time, but I know that unexpected things do occur.\r\n\r\n[b]To join:[/b] [email=Jinx@side7.com]E-mail me[/email] or reply to this message with the following information:\r\n\r\nName/Alias\r\nE-mail address\r\nGallery/Website link\r\nPreferred character drawn with link to information or reference images (optional)\r\n\r\nIf you want to be a backup artist in case a participant can\'t finish their image for whatever reason, please specify that in your e-mail/reply.  You are not committing to anything, this is simply offering to draw another image for any artist whose intended Secret Santa can\'t fulfill their duties.  I\'ll contact you ahead of time in such a case and see if you\'re still available before handing over the assignment.\r\n\r\nSignup for the picture exchange begins [b]now[/b].  That means that everyone who has expressed interest must still e-mail or reply to this thread with this information.  And remember, you have until [b]December 1st[/b] to sign up.\r\n\r\n[b]And finally:[/b] Have fun!  I can tell you from past experience that this is a great way to meet new artists and both drawing an image and receiving one are a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or if I\'ve left anything out, please don\'t hesitate to let me know.

You need to do a little research, perhaps even practice a bit, before tackling anything that means so much to you.\r\nA little plastic horse is not made of the same stuff as a Corvette.  Plastic varies in quality and type.  What works for one type or hardness of plastic might not work for another.  For example, there are a number of different paints which can be safely used to customize a plastic horse while the paint put on a car would probably melt the horse.\r\nIf you\'re in doubt or not entirely sure, you should first research what you want to do, including talking to those who have done these sorts of customizations before.  Since you\'re reading this, you\'ve already got the most useful research tool available: the internet. ;)',0,'2006-12-02 18:20:02','2006-12-02 18:20:02',0,'207.200.116.72 - cache-ntc-ab08.proxy.aol.com',NULL),

In my problem, the rocker switch on the stylus is worn out, and so the slightest pressure on it (even accidental pressure) will cause it to register a click, and it doesn\'t reset and come out of \"active\" mode.  Check to ensure you get a good firm click out of your rocker switch, and that it returns to the neutral state afterwards.\r\n\r\n[quote]the other weird thing it does is it will not give me a fine to bold line at all. when i first turn on the PC and go into PS to draw, my line is something like a big fat sharpie line. something you would expect if you were drawing with a mouse or using the old standard Window\'s paint program, you know, the one that only gives you three choices each for brush size and shape? [/quote]\r\n\r\nDefinitely sounds like the stylus isn\'t registering pressure sensitivity, or that Photoshop 7\'s settings for pressure sensitivity (yes, you have to activate it in PS as well) has been lost somehow.  But, if you say it is registering in the Wacom config screen, I\'m leaning more towards the Photoshop setting being the issue.  If your stylus wasn\'t registering pressure sensitivity, it would register it for no software.\r\n\r\n[quote]i\'ve taken care of my pen. i havent abused it or allowed to be abused. i\'m the only one that uses it... its never gotten wet, never been stepped on, and if it was dropped it was always on thick carpet..... but i dont know anything about this stuff.... \r\ndo you think its the pen or what? [/quote]\r\n\r\nAt this moment, with all that you\'ve described, I would wager that it\'s probably the stylus\' rocker switch that is the main culprit.  That\'s just something that wears out.  Simple wear and tear.  My stylus has never been abused in any way, and the rocker switch has pretty much rendered my stylus unusable as a result.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I would try, is calling up Wacom customer support and describing your problems to them, and get a definitive answer from them.  They might have some suggestions that I or others haven\'t thought of.\r\n\r\nBut, all in all, your tablet isn\'t that old, so I think the price of a new stylus is well worth it over the price of a whole new tablet.\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2006-12-03 10:09:21','2006-12-03 10:09:21',0,'68.49.246.5 - c-68-49-246-5.hsd1.va.comcast.net',NULL),

Unfortunately, it\'s all been infrastructure work, so there\'s nothing to show you, yet. However, once that work is done, then the visible work can be started. Once that work is done, we can begin to provide you with screenshots of v4. I\'m hoping that you all will like it. There are well over 120 new features and updates going into this project, making this the best Side 7 web site, ever.\r\n\r\nHappy news! Side 7\'s P.O. Box has returned. We will be releasing the new mailing address soon. I have to update the web site with it, and once I do that, I\'ll announce it here.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Side 7 staff will be attending at least two conventions in 2007! Please come and see us! We\'re planning on being at [url=http://www.anthrocon.org/]AnthroCon 2007[/url] (5-8 July, 2007), and we are panelists at [url=http://www.tekkoshocon.com/]TekkoshoCon[/url] (13-15 April, 2007)!\r\n\r\nAnd that, is what\'s happening at Side 7. I hope that everyone has a Happy Holiday, whatever you may celebrate. And, if you don\'t celebrate anything at this time of year, I hope you stay safe, and survive the maniacal shopping season!\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2006-12-18 11:49:46','2006-12-18 11:51:56',1,'69.3.86.30 - Fairfax-fw.pccc.com',NULL),

(1333,124,536,'A guide on giving critiques','[b]This is something of a rough draft which I may refine later if people find this info useful[/b] (this is also a crosspost but anyways)\r\n\r\nMany times artists ask for critiques but often do not understand what the term means. I\'ll start off with a Wiki article:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critic\r\n\r\nNow there are many thoughts of what a critique is, one common misconception is that it is negative.\r\n\r\nIf you understand the word you\'ll realize you\'re actually supposed to look at a piece more closely and give reasons why you liked and/or disliked a piece.\r\n\r\n\"This is cool\" is not a critique, similarly \"this sucks,\" is not a critique. Neither give merit as to why after analysis of the piece you decided to give such a comment.\r\n\r\nCritiques can be balanced, or weighted positively, or negatively. For diplomatic reasons, a balanced critique tends to be preferred, especially for artists that are emotional or sensitive to such remarks.\r\n\r\nWhen an artist is asking for a critique, the artist must understand what they\'re asking for too.\r\n\r\nGenerally, a person will look at your work and wonder about the purpose of such a piece. If the piece was meant to titillate, you\'re likely to get comments about the audience\'s own preferences and standards of beauty and appeal. While you are drawing for yourself, keep in mind the audience you post your work to will not have the same ideals. While many can be diplomatic about such works, some may not.\r\n\r\nYou may get negative comments when someone looks at your piece. The best advice to give to artists with negative comments is to balance and weigh them against how many positive comments you also received. It is human nature to focus on negative aspects than positive ones. It is to ideal focus on what you\'re doing right from feedback as well as what you\'re doing wrong.\r\n\r\n[b][size=medium]For Artists posting work on the forums[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind several things\r\n\r\n1. When you ask for a critique, focus on 2 or 3 of your best works if you\'re looking for an evaluation, and then post a link to your gallery following it. It is difficult for a person to give you critique by throwing in just one general url, and even more so if you have 200 pieces in your gallery.\r\n\r\nBy limiting it to your best works along with an url to your other works, this gives the critiquer a basis on style and are more apt to focus on more positive aspects of your piece because you in turn are showing your positive side.\r\n\r\n2. State the purpose of your piece. \"I just did this! critique plz\" what are you asking for specifically? Are you trying to construct better creatures and need anatomy help? Are you trying to create an emotional impact on your piece? [b]It is hard to ask people to be serious or give you thoughtful critiques if you\'re not going to be serious yourself[/b].\r\n\r\nHowever, it is understandable if you were creating a piece for the sake of humor.\r\n\r\n[b][size=medium] Common Problems giving Critiques[/size][/b]\r\n\r\n\"It\'s my style\" \r\n\r\nWhile there is some actual merit at times when an artist responds with this, both parties need to keep in mind a couple of things:\r\n\r\nThe artist: If this is your style, then it should show up on a consistent basis. If your works show much inconsistency then you cannot use \"style\" as an excuse. Also, people may point out their preferences or suspension of belief. If your works do not help suspend their belief, then it is something you need to take into consideration. When it comes to anatomy you must learn and understand the rules before breaking them.\r\n\r\nThe critiquer: Look at the person\'s gallery (provided they posted it) and see if the artist uses several characteristics in their work that is consistent with the piece(s) in question. If the person consistently draws fat thighs, commenting on how fat  the thighs are may not be necessary.\r\n\r\n\"you hate the piece\" \r\n\r\nA person giving you critiques in the negative doesn\'t always equate to hating the piece. Just as the artist is focused on the negative so is the critiquer. While this may fuel disputes, if you keep this in mind you may be able to curb bad blood from negative critiques if you can learn to do the following.\r\n\r\nIf a person finds something they dislike, make sure you ask them why (that is if they don\'t explain). \"I don\'t like this color\" find out why they don\'t like the color in relation to the work. The trick is to learn how to disseminate the information from your audience and find out if it\'s relative to your work. If someone doesn\'t like the color or line weight, someone else may. Just balance those comments out instead of getting upset over negative feedback. Asking why also makes the person become more thoughtful, if they don\'t have a good answer then they\'re responding in a knee jerk fashion, and you\'ll learn quickly whether or not you find their comments of value.\r\n\r\nCritiques are informative, those that say they don\'t improve with critiques -well it\'s a LIE! These are artists focused on negative comments, and not realizing what a critique is!\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all, if an artist is being told why someone likes their work, it causes them to strive more and continue using techniques successful in their work as well improve upon them. You get a positive critique saying you put a lot of detail in the fur and hair. Are you going to give up on drawing or do you realize you did something right and want to continue working on it?\r\n\r\nHopefully, there are some tips in here people may find of value when critiquing and receiving critiques.',0,'2007-01-02 17:27:07','2007-01-02 17:27:07',0,'63.205.145.84 - 63-205-145-84.ded.pacbell.net',NULL),

The time has come again..  ^^;;;;;;;;;;\r\n\r\nJust before Christmas, I bought an ATI Radeon 9250 video card for my simple little Dell 2400, mainly to play one game that I bought accidentally and I didn\'t want to have to wait 4-5 years for a new computer to try and play it then...  ^^;;;  Just to be clear, I\'m not a PC gamer and am not looking to play the most advanced FPS whatchamacallit on this bucket... I just wanted to shoot at stuff with a P-38 Lightning.  Apparantly, that\'s too much to ask from my machine...  [sigh]   So, I bought the cheapest card that meets the game\'s requirements.  \r\n\r\nWell, I only JUST got around to trying to install it and.. Well...  After installing it..  I turn on my machine only to find...  That it won\'t boot.  No error messages, nothing even on the stupid screen.  Monitor\'s plugged in but it\'s not receiving a signal... The system DID beep when I turned it on... But...  That was about it.  Shutting it off and turning it back on didn\'t do anything either.  Though, it didn\'t beep the second time.  It just stood there.  Power light on, no hard disk movement.  Nothing.  With a heavy sigh, I opened her up again, yanked out the card, put her back together, and then she booted up just fine.  \r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the instructions are pretty generic and says nothing specific about this model of card...  The most noise it makes is about connecting it to the power system which...  Is hard as I looked over the card...  There aren\'t ANY power plugs on it.  None.  Zero.  Zilch.  Just one tiny 2 pin connector labeled, \"Fan1\", mysteriously.  I\'ve looked over the written and digital documentation over and over again, no help.  I\'ve looked online, but everything I read are of people having problems AFTER getting the computer to boot and install the card\'s software.  Nothing about it not even booting from the start..  :\\\r\n\r\nAnyway...

(1402,130,2,'Side 7 v4 Update - Sometimes the straight and narrow is a tight fit (dev-blog)','If anyone tells you that it\'s a simple task to take data in one database schema and translate it into another database schema, beat them with the largest stick you can easily find on-hand.\r\n\r\nSide 7 has a database that is very large, has many tables, and is (admittedly) poorly designed.\r\n\r\nv4\'s design is far more efficient, uses less tables, better foreign key handling and indexing, and is flexible and scalable.\r\n\r\nPutting that design into use, and migrating data from v3\'s database to the v4 database is ... well, an exercise in zen-like patience and mensa-esque thinking.  Simple queries will not translate the data over.  I\'m working on a migration script; a very complex migration script that has to be written to deal with the migration in very defined steps.  Not just programmatically speaking, but also in terms of dealing with the database data.\r\n\r\nIn a relational database, data in one table can be dependent upon data in another table or tables.  Therefore, since the migration process is not only changing database schemas, but also consolidating data in some cases, and completely transforming data in other cases, there\'s an emerging, precise order in which data must be migrated.\r\n\r\nTo say the least, this has been a long process, and is still ongoing.\r\n\r\nOnce that is done, though, the migration script can be re-used time and again to update and reset the test data in the development database (and the final migration before v4 launch).  Additionally, once the new database is \"finalised\" and data migrated into it, development of the actual web site should pick up dramatically.\r\n\r\nI\'m looking forward to reaching that point.  Now, if only I could boost my motivation to a higher level.\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2007-01-16 12:54:03','2007-01-16 12:54:03',0,'69.3.86.30 - Fairfax-fw.pccc.com',NULL),

(1463,134,164,'Consistency in art','This is a topic that\'s been on my mind frequently of late.  I tend to, or at least try to, draw and colour in various different art styles, which often change with every picture I draw.  While there are some things, perhaps a number of them, that I do the same or at least similar in many or most pictures, I really don\'t feel I have my own defined style.  I enjoy and am inspired by too many different art styles to want to limit myself to just one, which is why I try so many different things.\r\n\r\nBut, I look at other artists who are popular and successful with their own style that\'s consistent with all of their art, which might not even be better than mine on a technical level, and wonder if I should try to find a style I can stick with in my own art.  I make art for fun first and foremost and I wouldn\'t give up on trying other styles, nor would I want to.  I just see people selling art, sometimes many different pieces which are essentially the same, and I wonder if I\'m holding myself back by drawing however I fancy without having my own refined, recognizeable art style.\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone even appreciates that I make art this way or if it would be in my own best interests to have a single style I can call my own.  I could stick with and refine a single style, I don\'t think there\'s much question there.

Additionally, [i]tasteful[/i] photographed nudes will be allowed on Side 7, as long as they maintain the same kinds of standards as artistic nudes that are illustrated: e.g., no sexual content, implied or explicit.  \r\n\r\nPhotographs that focus on the genitals will likely end up falling into the realm of \"sexual\" content for the sole purpose of prevention of abuse.\r\n\r\nThe problem faced by any art gallery is that what is art to one person won\'t necessarily be art to the next.  Gallery moderators and admins have to remove their own subjective opinions of what art is from their decisions on rules, and how to maintain a status quo on the site.  Allowing objectiveness to give way to subjectiveness opens to the doors to favoritism, inconsistent rulings on infractions, and worse.\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2007-02-16 12:27:59','2007-02-16 12:27:59',0,'68.49.246.5 - c-68-49-246-5.hsd1.va.comcast.net',NULL),

(1620,147,2,'Side 7 Site Update / v4 Update','[b]Site Update[/b]\r\n\r\nWell, it looks like the bug with upload counters has reared its ugly head again.  [i]sigh[/i]  I had thought we had beaten that one already.  Somehow, though, it keeps finding its way back in.  It\'s also one of those issues that is circumstatial, and recreating it has been neigh impossible, since I don\'t have the same cookies and such as the people who are having the problems.\r\n\r\nI\'ll just have to keep banging my head against it.  We had four reports of it over this past weekend.\r\n\r\nApologies to anyone experiencing this bug.\r\n\r\n[b]v4 Update[/b]\r\n\r\nThe migration script has come a long way, and is nearing completion.  Why is it taking so long?  Well, part of the issue has been the inclusion of the v4 DB development to coincide with the migration script.  Much of the original v4 DB design has changed as new issues have made themselves known.  Additionally, new and better methods of storing data and dealing with it mean that the data in the old DB has to be changed on-the-fly when being migrated into the new DB.  That transformation isn\'t always straight-forward.  Let me give you an example:\r\n\r\nData that is stored for recording what Rating Qualifiers in the old database is stored as a string of characters, each one representing which qualifiers a user has picked.  In the new database, they\'re being stored as a decimal representation of a binary number.  Let\'s say there are four qualifiers.  We can represent that as a binary number: 0000.  Each digit is either off (\'0\') or on (\'1\').  Once we know which bits are on, and which are off, we can translate that into a decimal number.  So, say your bits were 0101.  That translates to 5.  So, all we\'re storing is \'5\'.  That can easily translate back and forth from binary, which tells us which qualifiers are set and which aren\'t.\r\n\r\nIn the old format, we end up with a string like \"LND\" or \"NSO\".  We have to parse that out, and test for many different characters being present, each representing a qualifier.  Much harder to maintain or update the code if qualifiers change, and it requires much more tedious code to translate back and forth between the stored data and what you see on the screen.\r\n\r\nSo, in the migration script, we have to do all that tedious translation from the string (\"DLNSVO\") to a binary (\"000000\") to a decimal (\"0\").  But, once that translation is done, the hard part for data translation is complete, and we\'re ready to use the data for the new code.  But, much of the data is changing in that fashion from v3 to v4.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, with v4, the migration script is automatically excluding accounts that are empty (approximately 5000), and are older than 30 days (so you new members don\'t have to worry if you haven\'t uploaded artwork very quickly).  Likewise, accounts that have been flagged for deletion by user request will be similarly excluded, if your accounts haven\'t already been manually removed from the system.\r\n\r\nSo, that\'s where we stand at the moment.  Hope to have more for you soon!\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2007-02-20 12:41:49','2007-02-20 12:41:49',0,'69.3.86.30 - Fairfax-fw.pccc.com',NULL),

There\'s one person I know in particular who takes some really amazing photographs, and even not understanding why, they\'re beautiful to me.  I have been trying to look at them from a different angle lately, and while I can notice certain traits about this person\'s photography that really make it stand out to me, I just don\'t have the experience to [i]find[/i] those things when I\'m looking to take an artistic photograph myself.\r\n\r\nI am also limited a bit by my camera.  One thing that really shines in the aforementioned photos is focus and use of blur, which I can\'t control with my camera\'s autofocus.  Works great for capturing memories, not so much for an artistic background blur.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I\'m not really too concerned about it.  If I was really serious about looking into photography, I think what I need most - other than a new camera - is training, and I just don\'t want to take the time and money for that.  As much as I wish I would be, I understand that I can\'t be the best at everything.  I\'m just concerned that the pictures I [i]have[/i] taken that I feel are really pleasing to look at aren\'t actually artistic.',0,'2007-02-21 10:57:59','2007-02-21 10:57:59',0,'74.12.3.154',NULL),

Any art-uploading member account that has no artwork in it, and that has been in existence for more than 30 days, will be removed from the site during migration.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no distiction being made between \"used to have art\" and \"has never been used.\"  Unfortunately, there are many accounts in which people have decided to move on, and simply deleted their art to remove it, with no intention of coming back.  The easiest way to ensure that your account won\'t vanish if it\'s empty is to upload just one image, even if it\'s just a placeholder image.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those areas where v3 really fell short; there is very little in the way of account flags or the infrastructure behind them to be able to say \"do not delete this account for any reason.\"  However, it might not be a difficult task to add a feature into  v3 just to allow users to flag their accounts for \"do not delete\", even though the rest of the site won\'t ever use that flag (under v3).\r\n\r\nIdeas, questions and feedback: always a good thing.  Thanks for the question and additional thoughts on making this smoother for everyone.\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2007-02-21 17:50:30','2007-02-21 17:52:59',1,'69.3.86.30 - Fairfax-fw.pccc.com',NULL),

(1829,158,164,'Questions for convention-goers','I\'m considering getting an Artist\'s Alley table at Anime North at the end of May.  I\'m still debating it because I don\'t know if it\'d be worth it.  I also have very little idea what to do with it even if I do go for it, so I thought I\'d ask all of you.\r\n\r\nThe main questions to which I\'d like some answers are:\r\n\r\n1. When looking to buy a piece of art, or even just browsing, what do you look for?  Subject, style, dimensions, paper, mounting, etc.?  Would you buy a smaller piece of art at a lower price, say, 5\"x7\" or 4\"x6\" or do you prefer larger pieces?  Do you look at people\'s original characters or are you mostly interested in fanart?\r\n\r\n2. What other types of artistic items are you interested in, if any?  Sculpture, jewelry, costume accessories, etc.?  Again, what style or subject interests you in these media?\r\n\r\n3. What would constitute standard price for prints or other merchandise, and at what point would it be considered too high, or too low?\r\n\r\n4. What about an artist\'s table really stands out to you?  What draws you to a certain table more than others?\r\n\r\nI\'m sure there are many more questions I have, but that\'s all I can think of for now.  All opinions are greatly appreciated, on any or all of these questions or any other related subject.

Subject, style, dimensions, paper, mounting, etc.? Would you buy a smaller piece of art at a lower price, say, 5\"x7\" or 4\"x6\" or do you prefer larger pieces? Do you look at people\'s original characters or are you mostly interested in fanart?[/b]\r\nWhen I’m browsing the artist alley, I look for good quality prints on glossy, photo paper. I usually don’t look at traditional works because they’re more expensive. The artwork doesn’t have to be mounted. As for the size, it really depends on the picture. If it’s really detailed, I’m more inclined to buy a bigger version (8”x10”), but if not, I’d buy a smaller version. Unless I’m familiar with the artist’s characters, I usually go for the fanart. I find that a lot more people connect with fanart than your original characters.\r\n\r\n[b]2. What other types of artistic items are you interested in, if any? Sculpture, jewelry, costume accessories, etc.? Again, what style or subject interests you in these media?[/b]\r\nI actually don’t look at these things, but I’ve seen people buy pins, stickers, and bookmarkers.\r\n\r\n[b]3. What would constitute standard price for prints or other merchandise, and at what point would it be considered too high, or too low?[/b]\r\nI tend to charge my 8.5”x11” prints for $5-$7. I don’t think I would buy a print over $12 unless it was full-page color and detailed.\r\n\r\n[b]4. What about an artist\'s table really stands out to you? What draws you to a certain table more than others?[/b]\r\nI like it when the artist has a little sign telling what they charge for their artwork. It’s like a menu. I’m also attracted to a lot of color. Some people fan out their prints on the table or keep them in a binder for people to look through. Either way is nice.\r\n\r\nHope this helps! =)',0,'2007-04-04 11:37:11','2007-04-04 11:37:11',0,'129.94.6.28 - cache3.uwn.unsw.EDU.AU',NULL),

She looks prettier and more feminine than how I often picture her (which is more her self-image than the reality you\'ve captured).  Good work in bringing me to my senses there. :P\r\nI like Deidrei\'s posture; she looks very interested in what Baksrit is doing.  I assume Deidrei\'s braid is on her back, out of sight.  Her tail is nicely done, her clothing spot on, and those whiskers are cute.\r\nThe two look to be about the same height, which is good.  Baksrit is supposed to be only a little bit taller than Deidrei.\r\nAs for things you forgot, Baksrit is underclothed and needs trousers.  Her tunic has sleeves which almost to her wrists.  Since I like how you\'ve done her feet (though you can emphasize the big toes a bit more if you want), I wouldn\'t be adverse to her boots being off to the side, as if she had taken them off so she could get more comfortable.\r\nPhysically, while I\'ve not mentioned it in [i]Winterfur[/i], I see her having hair on her head as Deidrei does.  Her hair (white, naturally) is pulled back into a tail tied at the back of her neck.  You shouldn\'t need to erase those hairs on the top of her head since her hair can get a bit unkempt over time, but not excessively or unattractively so.\r\nColor-wise, her cloak is dark gray with golden symbols embroidered along the edges.  For the colors of the rest of her clothing, I\'ll leave those up to you (but they shouldn\'t be as dark as her cloak).  Her tail is a little over a quarter black on the end.\r\nGee, I sure quibbled a lot, didn\'t I?  I tried to keep it down. :( Eh, you\'ll get your vengenace when it\'s my turn.  I haven\'t drawn human faces in nearly fifteen years, so I need to work on those a bit before I can show you anything.\r\nSpeaking of which, can you describe your male character\'s face some?  While I could be wrong, I don\'t see him as clean-shaven or bearded, but with a few day\'s worth of stubble.  In general impression, I\'m thinking something along the lines of, say Aragorn, rather than Bruce Wayne or Clint Eastwood?\r\nLastly, since I have [i]Winterfur[/i]\'s entire first draft finished (in fact, I\'m stumbling about several chapters into the sequel), how much of it do you need to complete your set of chapters?

(1873,157,164,'','For having not drawn humans in so long, you seem to have picked it up quite well so far.  I really like the picture of Baksrit, too.  It helps the mental picture a lot seeing her that way.  I didn\'t get the impression of criticism; as I mentioned, for some reason I saw her less anthropomorphic than the others as I read.\r\n\r\nI like the way you\'ve depicted my characters.  (For reference\'s sake, their names are Damian and Domino, Damian being the female.)  It\'s interesting to me to see how she looks with red hair, as I\'ve yet to draw her that way.  I\'m still trying to figure out what shade it should be, so this is helping me to see what looks good and appropriate on her.  You seem to have gotten her colours down quite well.  I would give her a softer expression in the final image; though she becomes pretty confident and determined through the course of the story, she is still pretty feminine in appearance.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention previously - slipped my mind that her eyes are closed in the reference image offered - her eyes are yellow, like a wolf or panther shade.  Also, if you choose to draw it, she wears a tiger iron brooch shaped like an owl over her cloak\'s clasp.  I won\'t be disappointed if you don\'t draw that, though, I\'ve had difficulty depicting it myself.\r\n\r\nYou\'re certainly on the right track for Domino.  I would make his eyes and nose a little bit smaller and give him a little less of a widow\'s peak.  It does curve downward slightly in the center, but not much.  Feel free to add some variation or mess to his hair as well, if you\'d like to give it a little variety.  The colours look pretty good, though I would increase the saturation on his skin a little bit so it doesn\'t look as grey.  Broadening the shoulders a bit could help bulk up his stature.\r\n\r\nI updated the sloppy profile image I posted of him earlier, by the way.  I\'d forgotten that I was actually pleased with the redo of that sketch and coloured it up last night.  The [url=http://www.brain-lag.com/pics/characters/prof-domino.jpg]new version[/url] also shows his sword and amulet, but don\'t feel obligated to draw either one.  Both are usually hidden beneath his cloak, anyway.  (That\'s the reason he wears the cloak to the side like that; he\'s not well liked as it is.)\r\n\r\nIf some less tangible descriptions would help portray the characters to you, let me know.  I know that sometimes it\'s easier for me to draw a character when I know what they\'re like psychologically and socially, and there\'s certainly enough I could say about these two.  There is also some brief information about them available [url=http://www.brain-lag.com/pics/characters/tfw.php]here[/url], though I wouldn\'t take too much of the picture of Damian there to heart.  It doesn\'t portray her much as I picture her.\r\n\r\nThanks again for trading with me and sorry for going on like that.

Typically, I also have the cleaned-up scanned lineart saved as its own file.\r\nFor the actual compression, I first resize the picture.

(1939,169,164,'Using layers in Photoshop','I was asked to explain the processes I used in an image I completed recently, and I figured rather than let the progress images and explanations just sit on my drive collecting dust, I would share them with you all.  This is a beginner\'s tutorial, meant for people who don\'t understand transparent layers, and shows some general processes I use for making art (even though this isn\'t typical of my style).\r\n\r\nIn this image, I was provided a sketch that I had to paint over entirely, leaving no pencil marks or anything behind.  For reference\'s sake, I have hidden the wings layer in this tutorial.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.brain-lag.com/download/example-0.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nPicture layers in Photoshop like animation cels.  You have your background on one cel, one character on another, possibly the shading on another, etc.  Layers allow you to isolate certain aspects of a picture so that you can alter them without affecting other parts of the picture.  I tend to put different areas on different layers.  In this picture, for example, I had a separate layer for the griffin\'s head as its body and another one for its beak, its wings, etc.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.brain-lag.com/download/example-1.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThe layer for the griffin\'s head is behind, or below, the layers for its eyes, beak, and talons, but is on top of the layer for its body.  Whatever information on the layer for the head that\'s beneath the beak or eye is irrelevant, as the eye and beak cover it up.  The same goes for any information of the body layer beneath the head.  As you can see, layer order is important.\r\n\r\nSo, I start by putting down the base colour on the head layer, using primarily the paintbrush and eraser tools, though if I want to be especially precise, I can use the pen tool.  When I shade my images, I tend to use grouped layers.  A grouped layer will only show information on it that is visible on the layer it\'s grouped to.  As in this example, I used a grouped layer set on Multiply to put down the shadows on the griffin\'s head.  This allows me to easily modify and erase the shadows without messing up the original colour.  It also keeps the shadows contained to the griffin\'s head; I can colour as much as I want outside of the head on the shadows layer, but none of it will show up.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.brain-lag.com/download/example-2.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nI started out with a grouped layer set on Multiply to trace the feather definition provided in the original sketch.  The Multiply mode essentially darkens what you\'re painting over to the value of the colour you\'re using.  I generally use a darker and less saturated version of the base colour to put down my shadows.  Because this entire layer is set to Multiply, any colour I put down will darken the image, so I use this grouped layer solely for shadows.\r\n\r\nI use the airbrush to paint down the basic lines I\'m following, then use the smudge tool to give it a fluffy appearance.  I start out smudging with a medium sized brush at around 40% pressure, then switch to a smaller brush at 50% or 60%, then go to a really small brush at 70% or 80%.  By using several steps to do my smudging, it ensures that the final effect isn\'t static and uniform.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.brain-lag.com/download/example-3.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nI duplicated the layer, hid it, then began altering the duplicate to provide the detailed shadows on the head.  Here, I simply used the airbrush to add more depth to the feather definition I painted before.  I kept the original definition layer as a safeguard in case I messed up the definition in this first shadow layer.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.brain-lag.com/download/example-4.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nI created another grouped layer, also set on Multiply, to give the entire head a bit more shape.  It doesn\'t look like much on its own, but combined with the detailed shadows layer, it gives the whole head a lot more depth.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.brain-lag.com/download/example-5.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nAfter painting the two shadow layers, some areas still looked a little flat, so I created another grouped layer set on Color Dodge at a very low opacity to add in some highlights.  Color Dodge is a very sensitive mode, so you usually don\'t need much opacity at all unless you\'re highlighting something very shiny, like metal.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.brain-lag.com/download/example-6.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nYou can see how putting two Multiply layers on top of each other darkens the layer below that much more.  This is the head as it appears in the final image, although I hid the shading in another layer to show, again, how I separate my layers.  You can see that the inside of the griffin\'s mouth and its beak are on separate layers.  Also, to conserve file size, I tend to combine layers where possible, as is the case here with the beak and talon.  If you look closely, you\'ll also notice that the shading in the eye is hidden as well, as I put it on the same layer.  The shine of the eye, however, was done on a separate layer, so it\'s not hidden here.\r\n\r\nThe completed image is viewable [url=http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/Display.pl?act=image&iid=327569]here[/url].

I have been on Side 7 for a couple weeks or so, but I just now decided to check out the forums.  I had 4 years of high school art, a few months private tutoring after that, and on Aug. 27, 07 I start classes at Alpena Community College to get my associates degree in art and then if things go well I MIGHT transfer down to U of M to take all their art courses.  I put college off too long, it\'s time to stop procrastinating.  I am a little goth, a lot shy, and even more weird, lol.  I have 5 tattoos: tribals, wolves and Heartagrams (I am obsessed with HIM).  My fav. animals are wolves, dogs, rats and dragons (I know, THEY don\'t exist, lol).  I like to use Prismacolor wax-based colored pencils, Photoshop, Paintshop Pro, acrylics.  I also make dream catchers, do cross stitch, make bead jewelery, paint T-shirts, and drybrush ceramics.  I also like to write, read, make websites, listen to music, watch movies, swim, travel.

Some of them just don\'t look right to me.\r\nAlso, I\'m afraid, Deidrei\'s feet are still too small.  Lengthen her left foot by at least two-thirds the length of her big toe.

While most Duck artists have generally avoided placing Duckburg and its state of Calisota in any spot in particular, Don Rosa located the city on the north coast of California, about where the town of Eureka is in the real world.  This means, in the Duck version of Earth, the northernmost part of California (at least) is actually the state of Calisota.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Calisota almost had a real life counterpart.  In 1941, Gilbert Gable, mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, announced that the four southwesternmost counties of Oregon (Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath) should join forces with the three northernmost counties of California (Del Norte, Siskiyou and Modoc) and create the new state of Jefferson.  Gable made this proposal mostly as a publicity stunt to draw attention to the poor state of the state roads along the Oregon-California border.  However, people throughout the region liked the idea, believing the existing state governments as indifferent to their needs.  Siskiyou county especially embraced the idea as its county seat, Yreka, was chosen as the provisional capital.  However, the death of Gilbert Gable and the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December of that year put the brakes on any further plans for Jefferson.\r\n\r\n(Eureka is the county seat of California\'s Humboldt County which borders Del Norte County\'s southern border as well as the coast of the Pacific Ocean.)',0,'2007-07-06 23:37:57','2007-07-06 23:37:57',0,'207.200.116.71 - cache-ntc-ab07.proxy.aol.com',NULL),

Furthermore, the DNA of domestic cats, no matter where in the world they came from, are most similar to the Near Eastern wildcat subspecies, [i]Felis sylvestris lybica[/i].\r\nPresumably, as ancient nomadic peoples settled down in the Near East, their settlements provided new niches for animals which could live among humans.

(2177,179,2,'DevBlog - Side 7 v4 (30 July 2007)','So, v4 is progressing rather well.  I\'m getting terribly excited about the project again.  My apathy about it is ebbing, and my motivation is picking up.  I\'m finding myself more interested in spending my spare time working on v4 rather than vegging out in front of a video game.\r\n\r\nThe past weekend was spent doing some database structure updates for v4, and updating the database migration script to start importing new bits of data that I\'m now ready to work with (mostly image and gallery comments).  Doing this bit of fun has lead me to a major bug in my database migration script that was causing a memory leak, and reduced the migration run-time from three hours to fifteen minutes.  WOOT!  Go me. :P\r\n\r\nLayout designs are solidifying as I progress, too, which is making it more fun to deal with.  The programming style I\'ve been using for nearly four years now is proving just how extensible and reusable it is.  Maintenance and modification of code is really simple, too, so my primary global libraries are being updated as I roll, as well.  This, of course, causes those changes to trickle down to the other couple of sites that are using the global libraries, too, and improves their performance as well.\r\n\r\nTHIS is why I love doing this stuff.  I wouldn\'t rank myself as a guru of my language of choice or anything, but I\'ve improved in my programming by orders of magnitude over the last 8 years (my first foray into web programming with Side 7).\r\n\r\nI\'m keeping copious notes in a system to track the updates that need to be done, and it\'s great to see them being checked off almost as quickly as new ones are going on the list.  It\'s making the project much more enjoyable to deal with, that\'s for sure.\r\n\r\nNo screenshot updates this time, I\'m afraid.  But, more will be coming soon.\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2007-07-30 13:27:57','2007-07-30 13:27:57',0,'70.164.47.209 - firewall.pccc.com',NULL),

(2215,138,4797,'','Until about 450,000 years ago, the present-day island of Great Britain was connected to the European mainland by a broad chalk ridge which ran through where the Strait of Dover lies nowadays.\r\n\r\nAbout 450,000 years ago, an ice age covered Scandinavia, most of Britain, and much of the North Sea in kilometer-thick ice sheets.  A large lake collected along the ice sheets\' southern edge, fed by Europe\'s north-flowing rivers.  As the world warmed up at the end of the ice age, melt-water from the ice sheets also fed the lake until it began to spill over the chalk ridge connecting Britain and France, rapidly eroding the soft material and causing a massive flood to rip out what would become today\'s Strait of Dover.\r\n\r\nEvidence for this (as reported in [i]Science News[/i], July 21, 2007, page 36) includes the results of a sonar survey just south of England of a 100-km-long submerged figure dubbed the Northern Paleovalley.  Many of the features of the Northern Paleovalley resemble the Channeled Scablands in Washington state in the US, which was created at the end of the last ice age when massive amounts of water burst through the ice sheet which held it at bay and scoured portions of the northwestern US.',0,'2007-08-07 23:21:49','2007-08-08 23:03:49',1,'207.200.116.130 - cache-ntc-ac01.proxy.aol.com',NULL),

(2267,184,2,'Side 7 v4 Update - More Screenshots and Development','So, I\'ve been working like a mad man on v4 lately.  The majority of the foundation-work for the site is done.  That comes with a very heavy sigh of relief.  The foundation work, as I\'ve said before, is the hardest part of any project, and the part that shows the least amount of visible progress.  When you can\'t see progress, it\'s hard to continue.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we\'re now past that.\r\n\r\nI cannot count the number of nights I\'ve spent, staying up until 0400 in the morning writing code, when I have to be up at 0600 to be to work by 0800.  Two weeks ago I went through oral surgery, and I spent a good deal of the recovery time with a laptop on my lap, writing code for Side 7, even through the extreme pain and fog of pain killer drugs. :P\r\n\r\nVisible progress is one hell of a motivator. :D\r\n\r\nWith that said, I have a new batch of screenshots for you guys.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost is the main page.  You\'ll notice a better, cleaner layout than v3.  Our Featured Artist of the Day gets up to 8 images displayed on the main page, chosen at random (and they switch with each reload of the page).  There are also 8 images from the recent uploads, as well.  Additionally, we have the news blurbs, and the last five threads from the forums displayed.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.lameyhouse.com/outside/livejournal/s7v4_20070821_main.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nClick on a thumbnail, and you\'ll be taken to that image\'s display page.  A bit cleaner, with better layout.  The image page isn\'t completely, yet, as there are still more features to add to the page, but this is pretty close to what the finished page looks like.  The new navigation bar at the top now includes small thumbnails of the images previous and next.  Additionally, if you come from a non-gallery page, such as the Recent Uploads page, there\'s an additional tab on the nav bar to allow you to navigate either through the member\'s gallery, or through the non-gallery page.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.lameyhouse.com/outside/livejournal/s7v4_20070821_img1.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.lameyhouse.com/outside/livejournal/s7v4_20070821_img2.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nHere\'s the new gallery page.  Not terribly complete, but you get the idea.  The navigation has yet to be completed, so I won\'t even get into that.  What\'s there is a placeholder for testing.  Yes, gallery pages can be viewed either in list mode, or in thumbnail mode.  The thumbnails are larger in size by default than v3 (75x150), and users can choose an even larger thumbnail size if they wish (150x150 or 200x200).  This will help with image visibility.  Thumbnails are now generated through a new process that produces cleaner, clearer thumbnails, and any image resizing uses the same system.  v4\'s thumbnails and resized images are superior to v3\'s in clarity and color, as well as flexibility.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.lameyhouse.com/outside/livejournal/s7v4_20070821_gallery.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nLastly, my current tasking: the member profile pages.  This is still very much a work in progress, and much still might change, but I figured you all might enjoy the current results.  There is a tonne of information that goes on the profile pages, but it only shows if set as public, and filled out.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.lameyhouse.com/outside/livejournal/s7v4_20070821_profile.jpg[/img]',0,'2007-08-21 09:06:19','2007-08-21 09:06:19',0,'70.164.47.209 - firewall.pccc.com',NULL),

The Darian Calendar chops up the Martian year into twenty-four four-week months, each week consisting of seven days in the Martiana variant. The months\' names derive from the Latin and Sanskrit names for the traditional zodiacal constellation the Sun more or less appears in during that part of the Martian year, beginning near Mars\' northern hemisphere\'s vernal equinox (in order, they are: Sagittarius, Dhanus, Capricornus, Makara, Aquarius, Kumbha, Pisces, Mina, Aries, Mesha, Taurus, Rishabha, Gemini, Mithuna, Cancer, Karka, Leo, Simha, Virgo, Kanya, Libra, Tula, Scorpius, Vrishika).\r\n\r\nA Martian solar day is called a \"sol\" and lasts several minutes longer than an Earth solar day (one solar day is the time it takes for a planet to rotate so that the Sun is once more in the position it was in the previous day; e.g. from noon to noon). The Martian year lasts nearly twice as long as an Earth year.\r\n\r\nIn 1930, the IAU (International Astronomical Union) standardized the constellation borders so astronomers across the world would have one reference for positioning things in the sky. As seen from Mars, the Sun actually does pass through the above constellations on those days, though the actual times may vary by a days, depending upon year.\r\n\r\nAn observant reader will notice not twelve, but fourteen constellations represented here (Pisces appearing twice). Mars\' ecliptic (the path the Sun appears to trace through the sky over the course of a year) lies very close to Earth\'s, but does not lie in the exact same direction. While both ecliptics pass through the constellation Ophiuchus (the Serpent Holder), Mars\' also clips a corner of Cetus (the Whale). In fact, Earth is the only known planet in the solar system whose ecliptic doesn\'t. While other would-be astrologers would probably lump the few days of Cetus in with Pisces, this horrorscope splits Pisces into its two fish, the Western Fish and the Northern Fish, as established by many pre-IAU stellar cartographers.',0,'2007-09-13 23:12:27','2007-09-13 23:12:27',0,'207.200.116.130 - cache-ntc-ac01.proxy.aol.com',NULL),

(2372,190,4797,'A Properly Modern Horrorscope','Over the past few centuries, if not millennia, precession made the Western astrological horoscope imprecise in its alignment with the real constellations. Therefore, I have compiled a modernized horrorscope which I believe may be more useful to today\'s audiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=14]A Properly Modern Horrorscope[/size][/b]\r\n\r\n~ [b]Virgo[/b] [i](Sep. 16 - Oct. 30)[/i]: Some of you can\'t claim to be virgins anymore. In which case, you ought to be a Boötes, instead. True, the Sun doesn\'t go through the Herdsman (at least from Earth), but when has that stopped you from looking at a horoscope? After all, the Sun didn\'t enter Virgo on August 22, despite what all those other horoscopes want you to believe.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Libra[/b] [i](Oct. 31 - Nov. 22)[/i]: If you work for scale, you probably would like some tips. Tip Number One: find a job you actually like.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Scorpius[/b] [i](Nov. 23 - Nov. 29)[/i]: Perhaps you tend to pinch pennies, an inch, or someone\'s derrière. Most likely, it\'s not what you pinch, but that you like to pinch.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Ophiuchus[/b] [i](Nov. 30 - Dec. 17)[/i]: If you insist upon playing doctor, get a room. Patients don\'t like to be left out in the cold.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Sagittarius[/b] [i](Dec. 18 - Jan. 18 )[/i]: Be careful when dancing. You might discover you have two left feet.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Capricornus[/b] [i](Jan. 19 - Feb. 15)[/i]: No matter what you try, do you feel like you always end up as the goat? Don\'t feel bad; you can always punt the other fellow in the seat of the pants.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Aquarius[/b] [i](Feb. 16 - Mar. 11)[/i]: Are you all wet? Get a towel.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Pisces[/b] [i](Mar. 12 - Apr. 18 )[/i]: Do you fish for a wish? Good luck.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Aries[/b] [i](Apr. 19 - May 13)[/i]: Feeling golden? Make sure it\'s not gilt.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Taurus[/b] [i](May 14 - Jun. 19)[/i]: Avoid china shops.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Gemini[/b] [i](Jun. 20 - Jul. 20)[/i]: Double, double, toil and trouble. Fires burn and cauldron bubble. Learn to cook, on the double.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Cancer[/b] [i](Jul. 21 - Aug. 9)[/i]: Feeling crabby? Just don\'t get stepped on.\r\n\r\n~ [b]Leo[/b] [i](Aug. 10 - Sep. 15)[/i]: Watch where you pussyfoot around. You might step in something.\r\n\r\n \r\n[b]The Fiddly Bits:[/b] The above horrorscope uses the thirteen constellations of the ecliptic (the apparent path of the Sun through the sky over the course of a year). As seen from Earth, the Sun appears to lie in each constellation on these dates, though they may be off by a day depending upon year. The planets and Moon actually meander through a modern day zodiac of twenty-one constellations.\r\n\r\nAn attentive reader will notice thirteen constellations in the ecliptic rather than the twelve signs associated with Western astrology. The Sun actually spends more time in the constellation of Ophiuchus (the Serpent Bearer) than in Scorpius. Scorpius and Capricornus also happen to be the official names of the Scorpion and the Sea-Goat, respectively. In 1930, the IAU (International Astronomical Union) set the official boundaries and names of today\'s eighty-eight constellations, giving astronomers across the world a standardized reference for locating objects in the sky.\r\n\r\nBroadly defined as the natural \"wobble\" of Earth\'s axis, precession causes the stars to appear to slowly drift to the east over the course of centuries. Four thousand years ago, the so-called \"first point of Aries\" entered the constellation of Aries, but left it about 2000 years ago. Right now, the point lies most of the way through Pisces and should enter Aquarius in about 500 to 600 years.\r\n\r\nYou may find having a knowledge of the Greek and Roman myths behind the above constellations to be helpful in trying to figure out the entries.',0,'2007-09-16 19:29:37','2007-09-16 19:29:37',0,'207.200.116.130 - cache-ntc-ac01.proxy.aol.com',NULL),

The researchers found that the Baptistina asteroids were spread out over a region containing two places where a gentle gravitational nudge could kick an asteroid out of the belt and into the inner solar system.\r\n\r\nSimulations tracing the Baptistina group of asteroids back in time revealed that they appear to have come from a single, 170-kilometer-wide rock which got shattered by another asteroid some 160 million years ago.  Twenty percent of the resulting rubble eventually escaped the asteroid belt with one-tenth of those reaching in at least as far as Earth, doubling the number of objects hitting the planet over the past 150 million years.  Fortunately, we seem to be at the tail end of this \"asteroid shower\".\r\n\r\nStudies of the sediments left behind by the Chicxulub meteorite indicate its composition matches that of the Baptistina asteroids more so than any other likely candidate.  The researchers give a 90 percent chance that the dinosaur-killer meteorite was a Baptistina asteroid.\r\n\r\n[i]Source: [/i]Science News[i], September 8, 2007 issue[/i]',0,'2007-09-21 01:35:39','2007-09-21 01:35:39',0,'207.200.116.130 - cache-ntc-ac01.proxy.aol.com',NULL),

Not as much progress since my last update, much to my chagrin, but with good reason.\r\n\r\nI have moved to a new employer, doing very similar work to what I was already doing for Peregrine.  Said employer offered me almost twice what I was making previously, plus benefits enough to make Donald Trump jealous.  How could I turn that down? :)  The unfortunate side of this is that the new office is 15-20 minutes further away than my previous employer.  That means my day starts at about 06: 30 (to be at work by 09:00), and I don\'t get home until 18: 30 or so.  Long days.\r\n\r\nI\'m also in a state of learning my new employer\'s product (now, my product), and all the code behind it.  Very interesting stuff there, but there is a lot of it.  So, my head is swimming in code, old and new.\r\n\r\nThere [i]has[/i] been progress on S7v4; it\'s just been very slow lately.  Between the new work at the new employer, and the extensive ramp-down work at the old employer for the previous two weeks, motivation to bury myself in code in my off-time wasn\'t very high.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I\'m about 80% done with the public side of things (what people see when they come to the site).  After I finish up that stuff, then comes the management side of things (user account management pages, admin/moderator pages, etc.) and any new tweaks that need to be made to the public side of things.  My hope is that we\'ll be able to launch either by the end of the year, or very early in 2008.\r\n',0,'2007-10-09 11:13:27','2007-10-09 11:13:27',0,'72.245.188.90 - h-72-245-188-90.mclnva23.covad.net',NULL),

It\'s the MMOSRPG [url=www.furcadia.com][i]Furcadia[/i][/url], which can be described in an over-simplified manner as a chat room with graphics which allow you to see everyone.  Players (AKA \"furres\") can Socialize (OOC stuff) or role play in one of two manners (the IC stuff) – Persona (anything goes) and Strict (continuity first).  More info on the two types of role play can be found [url=http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?showtopic=29399]here[/url].\r\n\r\nNaturally, in order to keep players from ruining a Strict RP continuity, rules have to be laid down, backstory filled in, ways of solving disputes created, statistics need to be kept (in some cases, anyway).  Some groups require newcomers to fill out applications and character sheets if they want to join the group.  I know it\'s necessary to prevent players from willfully or accidentally screwing up the continuity.  I have no gripe with that.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it also scares away newcomers, intimidated by all the paperwork after a long day at work or school.  And then established role players have the audacity to complain that those intimidated newcomers are really just lazy.  Then they grouse that role play is dying, in need of new blood, even though they\'re making sure they\'re keeping people [i]out[/i] of their role play.  They type out pages of continuity stuff on their websites, but don\'t say a word about what sort of fun a newcomer can have role playing there.  To me that sends the message that the players aren\'t important, only the continuity.',0,'2007-11-04 18:13:51','2007-11-04 18:13:51',0,'207.200.116.130 - cache-ntc-ac01.proxy.aol.com',NULL),

It tied for first place with two others.\r\n\r\n[quote][b][size=14]How Grasshopper Mouse Got His Howl[/size][/b][/quote][quote]In the BeforeTime, when mice took their first steps in the World, they encountered many other species, some uncaring, some indifferent, most dangerous.  They feared the cats above all, whispering in frightened little voices of the felines\' love of torment and cruelty.  The mice took to small places, hiding from the horrible gaze of the cats who would hunt them down and kill them.\r\n\r\nBut Grasshopper Mouse felt only discontent in the shadows and small places his tribe scurried within.  He stared out at the wide World denied his people, and anger stirred within his heart.  \"Why should mice be forever prey?\" Envy whispered in his ear, \"Mice deserve this World as much as the cats and dogs do.  Why should we hide?\"  Grasshopper Mouse resolved to seek out a teacher who could show him the predators\' ways and free his people from the chains of fear.  He journeyed far and wide, relentless in his hunt, ever seeking the right predator.  He sought out Mountain Lion and Lynx, but they scoffed at the notion.  \"A mouse seeks to be more than he is?\" they snorted in derision.  \"Fool! Return to your tribe and accept your lot!\"  He asked Gray Fox and Red Fox, but they tried to eat him for their supper.  \"Fool!\" they laughed.  \"Mice do not belong in our ranks! They belong in our bellies!\"\r\n\r\nFrustrated, but resolute, Grasshopper Mouse traveled on until he found Dire Wolf.  \"Here is a creature even the cats fear,\" thought Grasshopper Mouse.  \"Surely, I can learn from him.\"  Dire Wolf merely laughed at the impudent creature.  \"I may be the last of my tribe, ruined by those accursed cats, but never have we been as lowly as mice! Why should I teach you?\"  Grasshopper Mouse grew angry at Dire Wolf\'s words.  \"If you will not teach me, I will find my own way or die trying!\" he shouted.  \"I see fire in your heart,\" replied Dire Wolf, impressed by Grasshopper Mouse\'s boldness.  \"But you need more than passion to be a Dire Wolf!\"  \"Then show me!\" demanded Grasshopper Mouse.  \"Show me how to be like the Dire Wolf! Let the Dire Wolf live on through me and my tribe.\"\r\n\r\nDire Wolf agreed and taught Grasshopper Mouse the ways of a canine, bestowing upon him the secrets of the hunt, the knowledge of the pack, and the wisdom and customs of Dire Wolf\'s own lost tribe.  Lastly, Dire Wolf took the WolfSong in his heart and placed it within Grasshopper Mouse\'s breast.  \"Hear the Great Chorus,\" Dire Wolf said.  \"Add your Voice to it, and you will be called Kin to Wolf and Dog.\"  Listening to the ululations of wolves and coyotes and dogs rising to the sky, Grasshopper Mouse threw back his small head and gave forth a shrill howl, defiant and fierce.  The Great Chorus answered him, lifting his cries to the sky as their new brother.  Grasshopper Mouse knew he had at last learned what he most desired and bore his gifts back to his tribe.  He taught them the ways of the lost Dire Wolves and gave each the secret of the WolfSong in his heart.\r\n\r\nTo this day, when the Full Moon shines high over the sky, listen closely, and you shall hear this smallest kin of wolves sing in the Great Chorus, praising the last Dire Wolf and the Song he gave them.[/quote]\r\n\r\nAs a side note, grasshopper mice really do exist, and they really do act like little wolves, right down to their howls.',0,'2007-11-27 02:28:14','2007-11-27 02:30:59',1,'207.200.116.130 - cache-ntc-ac01.proxy.aol.com',NULL),

Her friends and neighbors verified that their apartments were not the source of the music, while local radio stations were checked to make sure their signals weren\'t being picked up by the woman\'s hearing aids.  Even a soundproof room didn\'t provide her with any relief.  The incessant playing got to be so bad that she changed part of her previously made funeral guideline so that \"When Irish Eyes are Smiling\" (which she had heard over 50 times in her head) would not be played as she originally intended.\r\n\r\nThe only health problems she had were otosclerosis (an ear infection that can interefere with hearing) and arthritis.  However, this did lead to the clue to the nature of the problem, her taking 12 aspirin tablets a day.  Her blood level of the active chemical in aspirin was much greater than what was considerd normal during aspirin treatment.  When she switched to taking 6 aspirin a day, the music stopped.\r\n\r\nLarge doses of aspirin taken over an extended period can cause a ringing in the ears or hearing loss, but this was apparently the only case (at the time) of an aspirin-induced songfest, possibly with contributions from the ear infection and anxiety caused by making funeral instructions.',0,'2007-12-15 18:49:45','2007-12-15 18:49:45',0,'207.200.116.130 - cache-ntc-ac01.proxy.aol.com',NULL),

(2655,205,2,'DevBlog Update - The Status of Side 7 v4.0 - 09 January 2008','It would appear that I haven\'t updated the world on v4 in a while.  I need to do so.\r\n\r\nSo, what\'s been going on with Side 7 v4.0?  A LOT, that\'s what!  :)\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, aside from taking a day out of my schedule to play and beat my gift of Portal from a friend of mine in Arizona (Thanks, 0berong !), I\'ve been spending almost all of my free time writing code for Side 7.  I haven\'t been this busy with code-work in years, and it\'s paying off.  Unfortunately, what I\'ve been working on is the high-level administrative tools for running the site, so I have no new major screen shots to show anyone.  Well, not at this time, at any rate.  I might show off screen shots of the administrative screens at a later date, simply because they\'re cool, but not right now.\r\n\r\nSo, why has it taken so long to get them done?  Well, as I said, they\'re high-level administrative tools.  This means that they have to be written very globally and generically.  Why?  Because the code library I\'m writing is designed to be used by multiple websites, on the same server, without needing customized libraries and repetitive code.  In other words, the library is GLOBAL and works for all of the sites I\'m working on and running.  The tools, themselves, are written so that customizations can be introduced on a per-site basis, without having to alter the global code.  It\'s hard to explain without demonstration, but the nutshell version is: Tool X that is in use on Side 7 is the exact same code that runs Tool X on any other site that I host and run, from the same library, with no duplication of code or unnecessary changes.  And what kinds of tools are these?  Account management tools, calendar management tools, file management tools, news management tools, and the like.\r\n\r\nSide 7-specific Admin tools are still in production, and will go much more quickly, since those tools can be written to perform Side 7-specific tasks, and I don\'t have to worry about ensuring that the code will work for other sites (since it\'s not designed to be run on other sites).  So, each site I run uses the global library, and then has its own local, private code library, too.  Works really well.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I have 21 tasks remaining out of the original 48 tasks, pertaining to the public portions of Side 7.  These include tweaks, enhancements to code that\'s been written, polishing of code, or fixing small bugs that have developed.\r\n\r\nThe site member administration tools (your image management, biography management, friends management, etc. stuff) will be started, probably this week.  At this rate, I can see v4.0 being completed and ready for beta-testing within the next few months.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is fair to put out the head\'s up that Side 7 v4.0 will include a mailing list that everyone\'s accounts will be added to.  This is designed to be an announcement-only list (as opposed to an anyone-can-post list), with fairly infrequent traffic.  The goal is not to flood your e-mail account with messaging from Side 7.  This list is designed to send out announcements from the Admins about important things that occur on Side 7, in case someone doesn\'t read the news and announcements.   These kinds of things might include, for example, contest announcements, contest winners, important changes in code or features, security alerts, and other such information.  So, I ask everyone to spread the word about this, and to ensure that the e-mail address you have on your Side 7 account is correct and active.\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2008-01-09 11:31:05','2008-01-09 11:31:05',0,'68.166.165.99 - h-68-166-165-99.mclnva23.covad.net',NULL),

The greatest part of writing the high-level code is the fact that I don\'t have to re-write foundation code every time I want to develop a new site. I drop the high-level codebase into the new directory, and immediately I have a browsable website (granted, there would be no content), with all the tools for managing accounts, templates, etc. ready to roll.

The era in which Leo lives is a dangerous time to be alive with mob bosses running the land, crime and drugs at an all time high, and you’re lucky to have a job that will keep food on the table. But of course for Leo finding work at a time like this is no problem. Leo is a fixer, if someone had a problem he “fixed” it and with the mob fighting over turf there was always something that needed fixing. But for one tired old wise guy has finally realized that the world he helped to build was no place for his granddaughter and so he called upon Leo’s services to help take her to a safer place to live far from the vices he left for her there.</br>\r\n\r\n        This story is one I worked on in one of my earlier writing classes as a game script. It takes place in a setting that resembles the prohibition era with some fantasy elements. Most characters are talking animals like the kind you’d find in a Redwall or Richard Scarry book. Leo himself is a fox. Although Leo would be considered quite the hoodlum he still maintains a strong, if not inconsistent, sense of honor; his way of balancing out things. He would be just another pawn in the ongoing tug of war between mobs bosses if he wasn’t so skilled in his craft. His expertise catches the eye of a certain long time client who has a special job for him. He wants him to take his granddaughter far from the city he helped to corrupt to live a clean life. It seems like an easy task at first glance but he’ll soon realize that not everything is what it seems.[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n    And now, on with the show.\r\n\r\n[quote] \r\n        Gunfire, smog, and vice is all that the town had ever known. Some places can at least boast about more peaceful times of doors remaining unlocked at night and the neighbors getting along, but for a place with no roots there was never a time. The town was a place with no name; it was merely a destination on the map comprised of roads-less-traveled and places never meant to be found. In fact, some maps don’t even have it marked, at least the maps that decent folk would carry. Although it had all the things one would expect a town to have like a firehouse, homes, and a mayor it was still just a hobbled together mass of slums, poorly maintained factories, and seedy businesses at least for the time being.\r\n\r\n        “Cold…” Oades mumbled to himself. His old body was not the fine piece of fortitude that it had once been in his prime. Claude, his butler, quickly covered him as he heard him mumble; mumbling made up the majority of Oades’ speaking ability in his later years. Although not quite the strongman of his younger days he was still much a king as he was in the day. Now stationary for the most part Oades had more than enough time to think of his rise, his luxury, his status, but most importantly how he obtained it. \r\n\r\n        The town is both a curse and a paradise mixed into one; for those willing to fight and do what is necessary it can be more of the latter. He sometimes wondered what life would have been like if he had been a sailor like his father or a factory worker like his mother; two hard working, honest people. Perhaps he would have had much less than he did now but still better off an eye, several fingers, and most of a foot or be one of the countless chumps meant to be exploited by people like him.\r\n\r\n        The stately fireplace crackled as Claude dropped a fresh log into the flames. Oades was wheeled in front of it so he could see it in all its glory. It was very large, about as tall as a man standing but mainly just for show with a shelf on top several decks high filled with ornate, and most likely dubiously obtained, objects. He leaned back and let a wrinkly old smile grow ear to ear. Claude had just poured him a glass of tea. He slowly nursed at it, savoring it like fine wine. Even small luxuries like this could only afforded by the best in place like this. \r\n\r\n        Oades settled more into his position next to the fire. This shrine to himself was there to remind him of all he had been through to obtain it. The fire itself was almost beckoning him to relive those old war stories from long ago. “It’s quite beautiful, isn’t it sir?” Claude knew how Oades loved his fireplace and what it represented. “Just thinking of all the blood, sweat, and tears you had to go through to earn such a place of honor can make one proud, no?” Claude wasn’t native to the Town like Oades was; he had no idea of the war he had to fight in order to obtain his “place of honor” and of course wars have their casualties. \r\n\r\n        Although he had lived to a ripe old age, better off than most the town had entertained, many of his friends and family had not. A childhood friend, an old drinking buddy, a beloved cousin, even his own son had been cut down in the quest for power and wealth. He leaned further back and stared at a poorly constructed clay sculpture on a prominent place in his collection.  “….Clyde.” His mood was beginning to change quickly from one of pride to that of sorrow and shame. He slightly leaned over to one side as if to stare off at something in the distance but instead was really trying to look away from the seemingly harmless lump of dried mud and filler.\r\n\r\n        Most parents would have been ashamed of a son who smuggled and shot people up for a living but to Oades it was another member of the family joining the family business; at least at first. When Oades lived the wise guy’s life he could not see what damage it had done him but when it was his own son it was all too clear, heavy drink, easy women, and a hunted existence was not a proper life for anyone. If he had his son years earlier perhaps he could have done something more to protect him but it was not meant to be as he slipped further away from him. Drugs, a scummy, gold digging wife, late nights with “the boys”, and finally that fateful day when they found his bullet riddled body in the snow. Death had always been a close companion to him but this time it was different, this time he was far too close.\r\n\r\n      “Who’s ready for dinner? ~” A youthful voice came from behind. It was his granddaughter Bonnie. For all the screw ups his ever inebriated daughter-in-law had performed this was one thing that twit could at least point to in her defense. Bonnie was everything you’d expect offspring of the upper crust to be: pampered and entitled and yet she was a sweet girl with a heart of gold deep down. She indeed was the kind of granddaughter you couldn’t help but spoil.\r\n\r\n         “I hope you’re hungry, Grandpa Oadie, because I made plenty tonight.” She considered herself quite the cook and delighted in making dishes that he didn’t have the heart to tell her tasted like rubber and cough syrup. Tonight was her ever-so-famous “Soup That Tastes like over Salted Gasoline “which he had developed a tolerance for. He cherished these moments with what seemed like the only decent family he had left. Even though whatever relatives he had left in the town lived in his manor she was the only one who ever willingly took the time out of their day to visit let alone cook for him. it wasn’t the forced kind that feels obligated like during a birthday or Christmas he knew it was the love only family could have for one another that brought her to him every night. \r\n\r\n        “Mmm….isn’t that just heavenly? ~” “No!” he chuckled to himself in his mind as he forced himself to consume the vile brew. When they were done she’d kiss him good night and it was off to bed for her but when he was  once more alone he’d look back to his fireplace, his shrine, and see only a graveyard where moments earlier was a monument to himself. His reminder of his struggle also was a reminder of his loss and a reminder that in time she too would become one of the countless others the town must consume in order to stay alive. Oades took one last look at his shrine but this time, for the first time, with contempt because he had decided that she would be the last one of his blood it would feed upon.\r\n\r\n     \r\n        “GET THE FUCK OUT YOU GREEDY LECHER!” Mr. Baxter didn’t take too kindly when certain kinds of folk made advances towards his girls. Leo found this out the hard way long before but he wasn’t about to let some crusty old man spoil his fun. Leo had been known to have been taking some liberties with some of Mr. Baxter’s more rebellious girls, although today he would only find the business end of Baxter’s new bat. “Cummon old man! I was only being friendly!” “My girls don’t need any friends like you! What kind of friend takes food out of their mouths!?”\r\n\r\n        Leo was there to collect on a long overdue “loan” from the latest in a long line of neighborhood big shots. One of the Town’s newest flavor of the month, there to terrorize and fatten up on the local townsfolk only to be carved up just as fast as they had risen. In fact, the cycle had just finished its course once more and Baxter was hoping his days of exploitation would soon be over. His deli would be no place for people like him once more, a respectable establishment of an honorable community once again. “Alright old man, no more games! The rent is due and you know it!” “I don’t owe that bitch anything! If she wants my money then she can get a job! A real job! And so could you for that matter!” “Trust me Baxter; you don’t want to do this. It ain’t smart like.” Leo warned him rubbing his head from Baxter’s advance.\r\n\r\n        If only things had gone smoother, the winter this year was considerably rough, in fact, some were saying it was the worse the Town had seen in ages. Then again, the Town always seemed to have such rotten luck when it came to the weather. There was a saying that if one didn’t know better one could think God was trying to return the Town back to the swamps and barren land that it once was. That night was going to be especially rotten, the kind of night you should be in bed curled up. A night he had hoped he would have been spending with one of Baxter’s girls, not just for the company but for the fact that Leo’s apartment not only had no heat but it was also missing a window and part of a wall and the makeshift repairs he had made that kept him surprisingly dry in the rain had no such luck keeping out the cold.\r\n\r\n        Leo had many things on his mind but at that moment his concern was mainly where he would stay for the winter. He was no stranger to the cold even when he was young he had always been a tough one. Although he wasn’t always the no-good-nick the Town knew him as. In those times, most dads were either drugging it up or jumping ship on their responsibilities faster than you could count but not his. His dad was always a proud figure in his life, he was so important. Why, people would come to him at all hours of the night to complain to him about problems they were having with a fellow business owner, a romantic rival, or someone that just made them very mad. And he, being so important, said he’d fix everything and it made them very happy. \r\n        \r\n\r\n        One night his dad caught him spying on him during one of those dark meetings, Leo asked him why all these people came to see him. His dad replied “Sometimes people have problems that are too big for them to handle on their own and so they need a “special friend” like me to help them make it all better.” It’d be years before he’d truly understand what he meant but when he got old enough to understand he’d become a chip off the old block. Leo learned that when you were a “special friend” everyone wanted to be yours and the Town became a less scary place. \r\n\r\n\r\n        It was getting late and Leo remembered that he had an appointment to keep with a new “friend” of his and it was one he would be wise not to ignore. Old man Oades was quite the legend in the Town. Although the Town had been around long before him he was said to have almost singlehandedly transformed it from a place where illicit goods flowed and ladies of the night plied their trade to a mini-metropolis where the rich got richer for those who knew how to bow; not that there still wasn’t much more of the first two to still be had. He had roots, power, and wealth. Every lowlife wanted to be him, every honest working schmuck who wished for more envied him, and Leo was now on the very short list of people who actually got to meet him.\r\n\r\n        “Alright Jeeves, I got here like I told ya I would. Now where’s the Old man?” Claude had been waiting for him in a predestined location, even for all the King’s men it still was not safe to brazenly travel at night; especially alone. “Master Oades will see you when he deems it fit to do so.” Leo was contacted days earlier about a special mission and was told to meet him there in the park. Although he was under the impression that Oades or at least one of the esteemed members of his family would do him the honor of meeting him in person if it were so damned important for all the secrecy and not send an overly dressed butler to do his dirty work.\r\n\r\n        “What the hell is this? What? Do you want me to pick up his laundry or something!?” “I do understand your confusion but we certainly wouldn’t have come to someone like yourself if it weren’t Important. Now, if you’d be so kind as to follow me we have much to discuss. Right this way.” And with that Claude gestured Leo along and they were off, both disappearing like to shadows in the sunlight. \r\n\r\n[/quote] \r\n\r\nWasn\'t that a fun read?

My first rewrite removed Solomon\'s flashbacks, but still has too much focus on his apprentice before Baksrit.  Therefore, I intend to rewrite the rewrite to keep it focused on Solomon meeting Baksrit.\r\n\r\nAnother chapter which has received a major rewrite is the one after the execution, where Baksrit and Jaims discuss Baksrit\'s reaction.  I replaced Jaims with Deidrei so I could develop her character more, especially since Deidrei becomes a major character.  I also added Baksrit helping Matreen clean up the drunken Deidrei at the end of the chapter.\r\n\r\nI also added to the end of the last chapter (not the Epilogue), so that Deidrei asks Baksrit for spellcasting lessons (instead of Baksrit telling Deidrei she needed to learn them) and that Baksrit sees Songern for a reason other than to tell him not to call her \"little bit\" (she wanted more information on what happened to Solomon, but Songern knows little more than what he told her underground).',0,'2008-01-29 01:39:45','2008-01-29 01:39:45',0,'207.200.116.130 - cache-ntc-ac01.proxy.aol.com',NULL),

The rubber molding compound I have recommends that I apply a resin spray to clay or otherwise porous pieces before making molds.  The spray is cheap enough, but I\'d have to order it, and I\'d sooner not go to the trouble if there\'s an alternative or if it\'s really necessary.\r\n\r\nSo, I wanted to ask if anyone could tell me how important the spray is to maintaining the original for the sake of molding, or if I could do something else such as painting it.  Even if molding it strips the paint or whatever, I\'m not concerned, I just want to get a good mold and preferably not destroy the original.  I suppose I could also make a mold using more clay, but we picked up this rubber mold stuff and it sounds pretty good.\r\n\r\nAny help anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated.

As a result, I\'m sure some people might think it\'s never coming out.  Well, it is.  And it will be worth it.  How it comes out, though, is what\'s being considered right now.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways this can happen:\r\n\r\n[list=1]\r\n[*]We launch when everything is 100% complete.  This will take a significant amount of time, as there is still a lot to complete.  However, once the global portions of the code are complete, the remaining work will be relatively quick.\r\n\r\n[*]We launch when v4.0 is equivalent to the current v3.x site in terms of features and capabilities, and then do periodic update releases to add in all of the additional features.  This means a release within a month or two, and then a new update every couple of months.  This won\'t launch the site with any wiz-bang new features, but will get the new site out there and in operation, while allowing me to work on the new features under less pressure.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nI have leanings and reasons for both arguments.

Nothing is at stake here other than the ability to say you wrote a novel, which makes it both relaxed and hectic at once.

[b]Woohoo![/b]  I\'m hoping this will be a smooth launch, and the feature updates will be fast-coming and smooth.\r\n\r\nFirst things, first, though.  It\'s looking like the actual site launch will [i][u]not[/u][/i] be performed by Thanksgiving.   It\'ll likely be the week after Thanksgiving.  However, beta testing will be starting the week of Thanksgiving.  Everyone who has expressed interest in beta testing Side 7, please contact me at [b]badkarma (at) side7 (dot) com[/b] to confirm you\'re still interested and available.  Don\'t fret, I\'m not expecting you to work on the holiday, itself.  That\'s a day for you and your families.\r\n\r\nSo, where are we?  Well, there\'s still a lot of work to accomplish before Beta.  The forums have been completely updated; that was one hell of a task.  It clocked 76 hours of work, alone.  Basically all of October.  There is a lot of account management stuff to complete, and the uploading system as well.  None of this is particularly difficult (well, the uploading system is complex and a PITA, but that\'s expected), but it is time consuming.\r\n\r\n[b]So, what can you expect from the launch?[/b]  Well, you can expect all of the features that you\'re used to on Side 7, plus a bunch of extras.  Additionally, you can expect a faster system, easier tools, image and member search, and a fresh new referral system.\r\n\r\nSo, with that segue, on to our major announcement: [b]Our new referral system![/b]  This is a system of which you *want* to take advantage!  For every person who signs up listing you as a referral*, you get an Account Credit bonus!!  Additionally, every time one of you your referrals upgrades to or extends an upper-level account subscription, you get one free month of the same level!  Every time, for each referrer.  Just think about that. :)\r\n\r\nStart early, and help make the Side 7 launch that much larger!!\r\n\r\n[i]* New account sign-ups only.  Existing accounts cannot retro-actively name a referrer.[/i]\r\n\r\n-- BK',0,'2008-11-10 13:05:22','2008-11-10 13:05:22',0,'68.166.165.99 - h-68-166-165-99.mclnva23.covad.net',NULL),

Almost 9 years later, I\'ve recently had a renewed urge to reach out to the S7 community again. \r\n\r\nYou see, a few years ago, I decided to switch to DeviantArt and basically left S7. My account is still here, but inactive. By some fluke, my request to terminate my account never went through. But now, I\'m glad. \r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to discuss and maybe hear others\' opinions on was why they choose S7 as their artistic forum. \r\n\r\nWhat sets S7 apart?\r\n\r\nI realized recently that I never really thought about my decision to switch from S7 to DA. I just did it for something new and different, and for sometime, I kept both accounts active. But then, I felt like I should focus more on only one. Honestly, I chose DA because there were more artists there. \r\n\r\nBut at DA, I also feel totally disconnected from any kind of community. It\'s so big, I find it daunting to even know where to begin. I rely on a very small network of artists that I know - a lot of them originally from S7.\r\n\r\nI remember the amazing community I experienced at S7 when I first started here.

The thing that pushed me over the edge was that whole fiasco with jark getting fired from DA\'s staff so many years ago, and the way spyed treated him and the site afterward. Sure, I can understand making a good business decision, but I also understand treating people like people rather than objects to be thrown away when no longer useful, and treating art like a form of expression rather than a commodity with which to turn a profit. My boyfriend mentioned S7 to me, having browsed here quite a bit but never having actually joined, and I decided to check it out. I found here exactly what I wanted that DA could no longer give me: a small but active community of reasonably intelligent people who treat each other with respect.\r\n\r\nI boycotted DA entirely for a long time, but I\'ve been back now and again recently. I don\'t upload there anymore; I only use it as a database for pretty wallpapers and reference pics that, for the most part, have no special meaning to me, and occasionally to comment on friends\' pics and prose. That\'s all DA\'s good for, IMO. But my art goes here because I don\'t want it being drowned out in a torrential sea that belongs to people who would rather turn a profit than care for their community.

I like it because everyone here is friendly, when one  comments on your art, it is very useful, sometimes you get the \"cool and great art\" but still all is very good. I find it a very good place to learn from, and have a good time doing it too.\r\n\r\nI have went to DeviantArt  long ago, because I discovered Nack The Weasel art there. I never joined there, all though I was about to at one point, but I got talked out of that by my mom (she didn\'t approve of DA). I don\'t like how the website is named \"Deviant\" it kinda bugs me, I suggest looking up the word in your dictionary. Plus, if people are so rude there, that\'s another reason to not join there.\r\n\r\nDaisy Hunt (Luckyladybug) was one of reasons to get into doing art and posting it here, her artwork inspired me to draw.

(Bad memories.... le~sigh) \r\n\r\nI am TOTALLY in love with the show called \"Dragon Hunters\". I talk with the main VA of Gwizdo and the first season director. They are VERY nice people the both of them. I\'ve had one of my designs that I\'ve made for \"Gwizdo\" used in the TV show. (They altered it slightly though. Poo.)

(3698,249,2,'Side 7 v4.0 Success, v4.1 Coming','Greetings Side 7 Members,\r\n\r\nWell, it\'s been a successful first two and a half weeks since the launch of the site.  We\'ve encountered very little in the way of problems with the new site.  As such, I\'d like to offer my congratulations to the Beta Test team for conducting an excellent effort finding and identifying bugs and problems before the launch.  I don\'t think things would have gone anywhere near as smoothly without them.\r\n\r\nThe development of version 4.0 of the site took far longer than I had anticipated.  As a result, it was decided that a large number of the features that were originally to be included in the new site were to be pushed off to version 4.1, and some even further to version 4.2.  What was unforeseen was the fact that schedules dictated that a very tiny number of features would have to be back-burnered to a small incremental update (v4.0.1) that will be coming in the next week or two.  This update will include the controls for profile images, as well as enabling the \"View Images w/ Comments\" and \"View Favourited Images\" options under the Gallery tab in the Account Management page.\r\n\r\nVersion 4.1 will be a large update, bringing with it a very large number of new features.  Primary amongst those features are the addition of Music and Prose submissions to the site, so all you composers, writers, and musicians will be able to share your works with the public.  Additionally, we will be adding in Creative Commons (http://www.creativecommons.org) controls so you can list licensing information with your works.  Also, v4.1 will include a comic engine for Serial Art portfolios for those of you who create and publish web comics, doujinshis, and graphic novels.\r\n\r\nFor those of you with higher-level accounts, we\'ll be including embedded graphics that act as graphical banner-like links you can put on your web sites, journals, and other web presences.  These embedded graphics will be available for individual images, as well as your full gallery.  When viewed, they will show not only a thumb of the image (if it\'s an embed for an image) or the latest 5 thumbs from your gallery, but also your gallery\'s or image\'s URL.  What better way to help garner attention for your gallery than having an auto-updating embedded image that shows off your latest uploads?\r\n\r\nRSS feeds will be coming back to the site.  Not only will there be an RSS feed for the Recent Uploads page, but also for the site news.  Users with higher-level accounts will have their own custom RSS feeds they can share so others can keep up to date with their uploads.\r\n\r\nVersion 4.1 will also introduce site skins to the web site.  These will allow you to choose how the site appears, not just in terms of colours, but in some cases graphically, as well.  When we are closer to Side 7 v4.1 launching, Side 7 will have its first site skin design contest.  Five winners will be chosen, and their designs will become part of the Side 7 experience as a user-selectable option.  Those five winners will also be awarded one-year 5 Star upgrades.  Other prizes may be offered as details are worked out.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many other features being included, far too many to be included in this e-mail.  Needless to say, Side 7 v4.1 will be huge.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patronage and support for Side 7,\r\n-- BK',1,'2009-02-10 16:18:31','2009-02-10 16:18:31',0,'68.166.165.99 - h-68-166-165-99.mclnva23.covad.net',NULL),

That\'s what the Custom Portfolios are designed to be (they will be coming in version 4.1).  Although, I think they\'re slated for 5 Star, but could be re-done to be 3 Star.

The whole point of the 5 Star, though, was that for those who helped the site financially, they would receive the most benefit.  By giving a free version of that, the motivation for the financial support is gone.\r\n\r\n[quote]I just know that t here are -3- things that people love on art sites and sites in general. \r\n\r\n1.

Somewhere, someone has to pay for it, which is what I volunteer to do.  It\'s a known responsibility of running a site like this.  However, as such, that causes limitation in what we can do, especially in the current economic climate.  And that\'s a shame.\r\n\r\nOnce version 4.1 is launched, we plan to bring back big contests to the site.  Not all of them will include high-dollar prizes, but some of them will include prizes like art supplies and the like.  We\'ve given 64-count Prismacolor pencil sets in the past, and those were darn near $75.00 US each.  We tried promoting a v4.0 launch party contest a while ago, but no one seemed interested in it, even after we advertised the grand prize being either a Nintendo Wii or a Sony PS3.  Not sure why that failed; perhaps we didn\'t advertise it enough.\r\n\r\nThanks for the input.  Definitely food for thought.  The unfortunate part is the funding, which is currently non-existent, for a couple of the ideas.  Unlike sites like DeviantArt, we\'re not corporately funded, and haven\'t been awarded investments of $4,000,000.00 for development of new features.  But, we can hope, right?  Anyone know of a rich cousin or uncle who wants to donate vast amounts of money to a grass-roots art gallery?  ;)\r\n\r\n-- BK',1,'2009-02-13 16:05:54','2009-02-13 16:05:54',0,'98.204.10.71 - c-98-204-10-71.hsd1.va.comcast.net',NULL),

Currently the Bronze/Silver/Gold stars are simply a commenter\'s way of giving a little extra recognition to the artist.  However, perhaps there should be a reward to the artist for such a reception.\r\n\r\nThe grading of comments is coming back in v4.1.  However, instead of being a 1-10 scale, it\'ll be a Not Helpful <-> Very Helpful scale, and will similarly reward the commenter for their effort.\r\n\r\n[quote]Uh?!

This is a two-fold feature where a member can build a wishlist of other site members they\'d love a commission or art trade from.  Secondly, it\'ll give the member a way of listing descriptions of images they\'d love for someone to draw for them.  Then, any other member could view the descriptions, and gift the member with one of the images (no charge will be allowed for this feature), kind of like an Amazon wishlist.

Eventually, the plan is to bring the actual drawing applications, and the display of new oekaki images, directly into the site so there isn\'t much separation.  The problem is, because there were two separate user systems between the main site, and the oekaki software, we\'re going to have issues merging the two user bases.

The feature would display with heavy caveats stating that by adding someone to your wishlist, it does not obligate them to actually do anything for you, or for free.  Likewise, any notification to the artist that they\'ve been added to someone\'s wishlist would have similar caveats.\r\n\r\nBut, you make a good point.  In the online artist community, there seems to be a pervading opinion that if you ask someone to do some artwork for you, that person is beholden to you to produce top-of-the-line artwork at the drop of a hat, for free, and right now.  I could see this feature becoming a source for drama.  In that case, perhaps it would be wise to add a user privacy preference that prevents people from adding you to their wishlists, much like you can prevent being added to a museum, or your images from being favourited.\r\n\r\n-- BK',1,'2009-02-16 15:16:33','2009-02-16 15:16:33',0,'98.204.10.71 - c-98-204-10-71.hsd1.va.comcast.net',NULL),

Not sure that many people paid attention to it.  I fear building a critique submission form, honestly.  The database set up for having two different forms of commentary would be a nightmare to maintain, for one.  Additionally, people would still abuse the critique form just to get the extra Account Credits for giving a \"critique\" over giving a \"comment.\"\r\n\r\nNow, giving people bonus Account Credits for highly rated and helpful comments (once the comment rating system is back in place) is a good idea.  Set milestones that, once a person has reached a certain amount of \"helpful\" comments, they get a bonus with each new comment.  And, the more they become listed as \"helpful\", the larger to bonus (to a point).\r\n\r\nI like the idea.\r\n\r\n[quote]Also I thought that having private comments defeats the purpose of commenting all together because no one can read the comment or even see what was written given the community too much along the lines of being private...its like coming to a closed door everywhere you look....you can still keep the comment private but make a sort of award system for members who wish to be more open.  2 points for open comments instead of private...and that allows private comments to remain but gives more incentive for members to be more open with the community instead of closed up and phobic like they already are.\r\n\r\nEncouraging more members to be more open allows a more vibrant looking community instead of its current shell like status is has right now.\r\n\r\nThe best thing to do would be to take off the private comments but that is my opinion entirely.[/quote]\r\n\r\nI disagree with the defeating the purpose of comments.  Having the option for private comments gives a commenter the ability to send their comment or critique to the member, alone.  Some people do not feel comfortable posting publicly, and this gives them the option to do so.  Additionally, (and I\'ve seen this happen) it gives people the ability to give stern critique of artwork without fear of backlash from that artist\'s fan-boys and -girls.\r\n\r\nI don\'t see how having the ability to make your comments private (or for the recipient of those comments to set them private) would decrease people\'s desire to comment.\r\n\r\n[quote]Finally last but not least add a clubs option (although knowing you you probibly thought this one up already as well) [/quote]\r\n\r\nYeah, this one came up earlier in this thread, and it\'s going to be in an upcoming release. :)\r\n\r\n[quote]I have been brainstorming lately to think of ways to bring the community more life and so far I have only managed to find things that are already apparent with members who ARE intrested in building up this site.\r\n\r\nI guess them words are my final say on everything the rest is up to you bro.[/quote]\r\n\r\n-- BK',1,'2009-02-17 10:56:14','2009-02-17 10:56:14',0,'68.166.165.99 - h-68-166-165-99.mclnva23.covad.net',NULL),

I\'m glad you asked!\r\n\r\nWeekly Challenges are an activity that we at Side 7 used to run (before we got sacked over the head with outside obligations that prevented us from running them on a regular basis).  The challenges are designed to help artists break out of the box and try something new and, well, challenging!  Once posted, anyone who wanted to participate could draw something that fit the challenge, and on the due date, all participants would post links to their entries.  Comments and critiques of each others\' works were invited, but not obligatory.\r\n\r\nMonthly Contests were similar, but spanned a month\'s time.  The contest would give each participant 3 weeks to submit their entry to a challenging topic.  At the end of the three weeks, one week worth of voting would occur (in private), and the winner would be declared at the end of the month.  Winners generally received a 2-month 5-Star upgrade.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is one or two volunteers who would be willing to reliably run these two events.  One person can do it, but two gives extra eyes, brains, and time to take care of things.  If we have multiple volunteers, they will be working together on these events, so the ability to work with others is mandatory.\r\n\r\nAll volunteers would report directly to Bad Karma.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re interested, [email=badkarma@side7.com]shoot Bad Karma an e-mail[/email] or send him a Private Message (badkarma).\r\n\r\nFeel free to give feedback and ask questions here in the forums.\r\n\r\n-- BK',1,'2009-03-06 19:20:41','2009-03-06 19:25:19',1,'76.100.10.96 - c-76-100-10-96.hsd1.va.comcast.net',NULL),

(3792,258,2,'Language Packs, Volunteers, and Updates, oh my!','Greetings all,\r\n\r\nJust a small update to let you know we\'re still working to give you the best we possibly can in Side 7!  As always, your comments, questions and suggestions are always appreciated.  You can submit them here: http://www.side7.com/contact_us.cgim?cu_mode=general\r\n\r\n[b]Language Packs:[/b]\r\nIn the effort to open the site to a much wider audience, we\'re looking to add language options in version 4.2.  This is a far-reaching goal that will require a lot of work, as well as some volunteers.  This will give each user the ability to select the language of choice, and all the static site text will be displayed in the selected language, as opposed to only English.  This will require building a library all that content, and asking volunteers who natively speak foreign languages to give us translations of each entry in the library.  Hopefully, we\'ll be able to get multiple foreign language speakers so that we can get cross-referenced and cross-checked work back, and no one can sneak in inappropriate language.  >:)\r\n\r\nSo far, with the help of site analytics, we\'ve been able to identify the top languages that people have their browsers set to: English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Finnish, and Polish.  We\'d love to hear back from our users on any other languages they\'d like to see featured on the site.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Volunteers:[/b]\r\nVolunteers are needed to help run events on Side 7! What events, you say? Why, the Weekly Challenges and Monthly Contests, I respond!\r\n\r\nJust what are the Weekly Challenges? I\'m glad you asked!\r\n\r\nWeekly Challenges are an activity that we at Side 7 used to run (before we got sacked over the head with outside obligations that prevented us from running them on a regular basis). The challenges are designed to help artists break out of the box and try something new and, well, challenging! Once posted, anyone who wanted to participate could draw something that fit the challenge, and on the due date, all participants would post links to their entries. Comments and critiques of each others\' works were invited, but not obligatory.\r\n\r\nMonthly Contests were similar, but spanned a month\'s time. The contest would give each participant 3 weeks to submit their entry to a challenging topic. At the end of the three weeks, one week worth of voting would occur (in private), and the winner would be declared at the end of the month. Winners generally received a 2-month 5-Star upgrade.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is one or two volunteers who would be willing to reliably run these two events. One person can do it, but two gives extra eyes, brains, and time to take care of things. If we have multiple volunteers, they will be working together on these events, so the ability to work with others is mandatory.\r\n\r\nAll volunteers would report directly to Bad Karma.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re interested, shoot Bad Karma an e-mail at badkarma@side7.com or send him a Private Message (badkarma).\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Updates:[/b]\r\nWork continues to progress on version 4.0.1.  The full list of what\'s included in 4.0.1 is as follows:\r\n- Bug Fix: Auto-URL linking not working in all cases\r\n- Bug Fix: Sticky Threads not being included in the forums status icon display.\r\n- Bug Fix: Replies to comments aren\'t notifying the parent commenter and image owner.\r\n- Re-enable: Profile image management and uploading.\r\n- Re-enable: View Favourited Images\r\n- Re-enable: View Images w/ Comments\r\n\r\nI hope this message finds you all well!\r\n\r\n-- BK',1,'2009-03-10 18:35:53','2009-03-10 18:35:53',0,'68.166.165.99 - h-68-166-165-99.mclnva23.static.covad.net',NULL),

This is a far-reaching goal that will require a lot of work, as well as some volunteers.  This will give each user the ability to select the language of choice, and all the static site text will be displayed in the selected language, as opposed to only English.  This will require building a library all that content, and asking volunteers who natively speak foreign languages to give us translations of each entry in the library.  Hopefully, we\'ll be able to get multiple foreign language speakers so that we can get cross-referenced and cross-checked work back, and no one can sneak in inappropriate language.  >:)\r\n\r\nSo far, with the help of site analytics, we\'ve been able to identify the top languages that people have their browsers set to: English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Finnish, and Polish.  We\'d love to hear back from our users on any other languages they\'d like to see featured on the site.\r\n\r\n-- BK[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, it is good to see to want to put \"Language pack\" for people that can\'t speak english, but what if someone who english goes to a gallery here with say... all spanish speaking and can\'t understand it.

However, we will have no control (and won\'t force control) over in what language someone posts the descriptions to their images, or information in their profile.  This is an international site afterall, and people already post image descriptions in multiple languages (take [url=http://www.side7.com/AmiralAesir/gallery]Amiral Aesir[/url] as an example).  The point of the language packs to allow users to choose in what language the standard site wording is.\r\n\r\n[quote]Not to change the subject, but when goes to comment, I noticed the password \"word challenge\" is on there now, what\'s up with that?

It was already planned for a later release, but the appearance of the spammers really pushed that up, and proved a need for it.\r\n\r\n-- BK',1,'2009-03-19 12:18:36','2009-03-19 12:19:12',1,'72.59.24.247 - 72-59-24-247.pools.spcsdns.net',NULL),

This was not our initial design, but over the past month and a half, our comment system has been innundated with spam bot attacks.  We had a number of site members whose images were being hit by these bots about every 30 seconds with new spam posts.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the CAPTCHA institution was hastily done to stop the harassment.  There are bugs in its implementation that are being worked on, such as the loss of comment data if the CAPTCHA is not performed correctly.  Unfortunately, because we\'re using a CAPTCHA service, we have no control over the two-word issue.\r\n\r\nAnd, unfortunately, looking through log data, the bots are still attacking the commenting and guestbook system, but at least now they\'re not getting through to the members.\r\n\r\nI apologize about this inconvenience, but it\'s become a necessary evil.  Personally, I find CAPTCHA systems to be annoying, myself.  But, unfortunately, until we come up with a better solution, this is what we have with which to work.\r\n\r\nComments, questions, and suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\n-- BK',1,'2009-04-02 09:48:55','2009-04-02 09:48:55',0,'68.166.165.99 - h-68-166-165-99.mclnva23.static.covad.net',NULL),

(3917,271,2,'Side 7 Update, and Request For Input','Hey all,\r\n\r\nIt\'s not typical that I inject personal updates into Side 7\'s newsletter, however, in this case, it\'s very relevant.  The promised updates have, obviously, not been delivered.  There\'s a very good reason for that.  My daughter was born 10 weeks early (born 02 February 2009, but was due 13 April 2009). She spent the next 81 days in NICU, and finally was allowed to come home yesterday evening.  We\'ve been spending a lot of time at the hospital (which is about 1 hour away from where we live), while trying to take care of our 6 year old son and our home.  Add to that, that I was laid off from work a few weeks ago, and you\'ve got quite the barrel of stress.\r\n\r\nNow that my daughter is home (finally), and we can settle into a realistic home life schedule, I\'m able to return to projects that need attention (Side 7 being a major one).  v4.0.1 is back on the front burner, to be released very soon.  v4.1 is to come after that.\r\n\r\nHere, though, is the problem at hand: Side 7 is not bringing in any money.  With the economy the way it is, it is understandable that folks don\'t have the available funds to upgrade to a 5 Star account and help the site out financially.  Unfortunately, with the loss of my job, I am quickly running out of funds myself, as all of Side 7\'s costs come out of my pocket.  As a result, I\'ve been reviewing my options for supplementing site income.  I\'m considering adding banner ads to the site (through Project Wonderful).  We\'ve always stated that we took pride in never having annoying banner ads on the site, but we also never anticipated being in this position.

After going through the wonderful art alphabetically up to \"C\", and seeing how good most of the drawings are, I decided to give it a try--and discovered I can draw!\r\n\r\nI\'m 38.\r\n\r\nAnyway, back on topic, I\'ve noticed that the large majority of art came from between 2001 and 2003 and most of the artists were in high school at the time.\r\n\r\nThat begs two questions for me:\r\n\r\n+ Why mostly within those two years--was it a short-lived fad, that school kids (no offence!) decided to draw while they were bored, or was it something external?  Essentially why the sudden surge and drop in popularity?\r\n\r\n+ Why mostly high-school people?  It wasn\'t just one school or one city, where word may have spread easily, but people from around the world.\r\n\r\nMaybe the answers to those may give some ideas.\r\n\r\nMaybe advertise around schools... Facebook... other teen websites.\r\n\r\nI\'ve also noticed that a large number of drawings were emo, angst, goth, blood, etc., as if the artists were using their art as a release, an expression of themselves.  Posting here may have given them needed attention and positive reinforcement.  Maybe a word to guidance counsellors and such...\r\n\r\nAnyway, just some musings of an oldie who\'s just realizing he has some talent.

(3991,251,2,'','Hey Electro,\r\n\r\nThanks for responding.  And thanks for joining Side 7.\r\n\r\nBack in its heyday, Side 7 was one of the few galleries on the net, and it enjoyed a lot of activity.  We have a no-porn policy which appealed to a lot of people.  High schoolers were definitely our largest demographic, as they always seem to be on the bleeding edge of social technology.\r\n\r\nThe drop in our activity and membership levels can be directly attributed to DeviantArt, to be honest.  They came on the scene in the early 2000s, had an extremely liberal set of rules, no upload limits, and tonnes of popularity-driven features.  Since then, numerous DA clones have popped up.  As of right now, the gallery space is saturated on the internet, with those having the least rules and administration and the most popularity tools being the most successful.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve got a Facebook page, and while there are members to it, it remains largely unused.  Same with our IRC channel, LiveJournal Community, and site features.  I\'m continuing to work on new features which are similar to many popularity-based tools, but (hopefully) done in a way that doesn\'t turn Side 7 into just another farm for popularity contests.  I\'d like the site to remain about the art, and not about who\'s got the biggest fan-base.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that stance seems to be the kiss of death, but we\'re still fighting.  We\'ll see how things go.\r\n\r\nAs far as the timeline between 2001 and 2003 being the most art, we had launched a new version of the site, and it had a lot of new tools.  We also had no upload limits.  Unfortunately, the lack of upload limits promoted the uploading of a lot of \"junk\" artwork (doodles from the margins of people\'s math tests, stuff with descriptions of \"I hate this pic I drew, but I\'m going to upload it anyway\" and such).  The volume of lower-quality images was vastly overrunning the quality images, so we instituted the upload limits to encourage people to be more selective about what they uploaded.\r\n\r\nThat turned out to be a double-edged sword, and I think was the largest factor in our losing memberships and activity.  I still stand behind it, though, since the quality of what is upload is vastly improved.  We\'re bringing in features that allow people to \"buy\" additional uploads with Account Credits, which are earned through site activity.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll see how it all turns out. :/\r\n\r\n-- BK',1,'2009-06-01 10:08:58','2009-06-01 10:08:58',0,'76.100.10.96 - c-76-100-10-96.hsd1.va.comcast.net',NULL),

Only took about four months.\r\n\r\nWhat I found really helpful was the ability to browse art by artist.  Not everyone has a style that I like, and, while it\'s nice to see examples from everyone, only a small percentage intrigues me enough to want to see the rest of what that artist has.\r\n\r\nDA doesn\'t have browsing by artist as an option.\r\n\r\nNow while I can see the security needs of that (it protects everyone\'s privacy a bit), I don\'t want to have to browse through a million drawings that I don\'t really care for, just to find one that I like.  I\'d rather see a select few from each artist and browse by \"style\", so to speak.\r\n\r\nJust out of curiosity, by the way, I tried to find the \"end\" of the listings for the category I was browsing there the other day.  In the Anime -> Traditional (media) -> Drawings category, there were roughly 276 million pieces of art, and growing by probably a few thousand per day.\r\n\r\nQuality is another matter, though...  here on S7, out of a page of 25 artists, I found myself looking through the art of between 2 and 8 of them (you!  us! :-) on each page.  On DA, I skimmed through the first 500 drawings before I found one that interested me enough to look further.\r\n\r\nAgain, the community on S7 is much greater and the quality much, much higher!  But then, we all have to learn somewhere, and if it wasn\'t for the volume of \"practice\" material there was everywhere else, we wouldn\'t know how good we have it here! :-)\r\n\r\n',1,'2009-08-25 15:44:45','2009-08-25 15:44:45',0,'68.179.2.116 - static-68-179-2-116.ptr.terago.net',NULL),

If I\'ve missed a holiday you celebrate, I apologize. :)\r\n\r\nWe\'d like to announce that version 4.0.1 of Side 7 has launched!  This small update brings back a few features that didn\'t launch due to time constraints with version 4.0, and adds a few other features.  Back is the management of Profile Images, and added are views of which of your images have comments and which have been Favourited by other site members!  A few minor bug fixes are also included, such as comment reply notifications going out properly.  Also, we added CAPTCHA security to a few areas of the site to prevent bot spam.\r\n\r\nThis update has been a long time coming.  If I might be a little personal, this has been a hard year for myself or my family.  Medical obligations, loss of employment, and the premature birth of my daughter all played a hand in forcing priority changes and delaying work on v4.0.1.  Fortunately, we\'ve clawed our way past most of the major issues and are digging ourselves out of the red slowly but surely.  This means that the doors are open to begin work on v4.1.\r\n\r\nVersion 4.1 is a very major update.  There are major back-end reworkings that will facilitate features such as music, video, and literature uploads.  Yes, we\'re adding these media types to the site, since they are all valid forms of art.  Video may not be added in v4.1, but instead might be added in v4.1.1.  Other site features will include the site skinning system, which will open with a Site Skin Design contest!  Winners will receive prizes of a year\'s subscription to a 5-Star account, addition of their skin design to the site (fully credited), and other prizes, such as art supplies!  Recent Upload and 5-Star Account RSS Feeds, as well as automatic Twitter updates, will help get the word out about your latest art additions.  Embeddable gallery and image tags to post to other sites or use in forums sigs are going to be another way you can advertise, and click-throughs from those tags will be counted and will earn you Account Credits!\r\n\r\nWe\'ll also institute the Invite A Friend system so you can earn Account Credits or Account Subscription extensions for getting your friends to join!  Speaking of friends, our Friends system will be completed in the v4.1 release, giving you access to private, friends-only uploads of your images, music, and prose that don\'t count against your gallery count and are exempt from the site rules (privacy has its privileges).\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the new features of the site and look forward to the upcoming features.  Thank you for your patronage!\r\n\r\n-- Bad Karma',1,'2009-12-25 11:34:00','2009-12-27 10:20:01',3,'76.100.10.96 - c-76-100-10-96.hsd1.va.comcast.net',NULL),

I have a bunch of other ideas in my head, but I\'d like to have a good excuse to put them down on paper, and I\'d like to see other people\'s interpretations of my half-developed brainchildren.\r\n\r\nSo, my request is this: Give me some of your anthro/furry/android/etc. characters and ideas to draw, and I\'ll give you some sort of random anthro/furry/android/etc. request in return. My own request will vary greatly depending on my mood; it could be anything from a Pokémon furry to an anthropomorphized toaster.\r\n\r\nI guess the best way to describe my style right now is sort of pseudo-anime, with defined lineart, bright colors, and hard-edge shading; the \"Mr. Charisma\" and \"Wirecross\" pics in my gallery are probably the most telling, though I\'m trying to get away from that thick-and-chunky lineart. Of course, I\'m willing to branch out from this style, and I can do a number of other methods upon your request, if you provide me with some style references.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you guys want to see? ^^\r\n\r\n(I should add, my schedule\'s pretty busy, so between the time it\'ll take me to draw a pic, scan it, color, and upload, holding up my end of the trade could take a while.

It\'s complicated but here\'s the idea:\r\n\r\nArtists post their work online usually for recognition, they like when another artist or admirer has something to say or has a few pointers. Right now it looks like traffic is terrible and personally I haven\'t gotten a comment on my work in like 3 years. It\'s really not a good social environment at all, and a good art board NEEDS that. I\'m thinking there should maybe be a level system with different rewards that come with each level. Users would get like, karma points for leaving feedback on another artists work. That artist could then choose to reward them with points, and in turn earn points for someone commenting on them. It uses positive renforcement to reward the behavior of commenting. We could call each level \"sides\" and the top level being \"side 7\". I have no idea what rewards we could offer for each \"side\" level, or how many points someone would need to have.

(4375,314,2,'','So, it seems we\'re all in agreement on a survey.  This is excellent.  There are two major things that need to be done to get this out the door, that I see: \r\n\r\n[list][*]Write up a survey system (which shouldn\'t be too difficult, or if we want to do this more short-term, find a free survey service that we can use).\r\n[*]Come up with what questions we want for the survey. [/list]\r\n\r\nHeather is right on another point: dA is a major thorn in our side.  They always have been.  When dA made it big, that\'s when S7\'s community suffered.  Many people left S7 to join dA.  As near as I can tell, here\'s why:\r\n\r\n[list][*]They allow unlimited uploads, both on a per-day basis and in total. [*]They don\'t have language filters.\r\n[*]They are less stringent on content rules.\r\n[*]And from what I\'ve seen personally, they don\'t police stolen, duplicated, or traced artwork worth a damn.\r\n[*]dA\'s community is largely a popularity-contest-type atmosphere. [/list]\r\n\r\nIn contrast:\r\n[list][*]S7 limits free accounts in both how many uploads can occur per day, and in total.\r\n[*]In an effort to be more family-friendly, S7 censors profanity. [*]Likewise, S7 limits mature content.\r\n[*]S7 lacks many of the vanity features dA has.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nHere are some features that I\'ve been considering adding into the upcoming v4.1 release of the site.  I\'d love some feedback on them, and if you think they\'d be helpful in terms of added value to the site and attractiveness to users. \r\n\r\n[list=1][*]Similar to Heather\'s Karma points system, I had observed a community driven karma point system on another site and was thinking of emulating what it does.  Users earn Reputation points through site activity.  Reaching reputation levels of certain ranks opened up new features, such as commenting, posting in forums, etc.  It also allows you to up-vote and down-vote other people\'s comments and posts.  Up-voting someone\'s post costs you a reputation point, and earns the other person a reputation point.  Down-voting someone\'s posts loses that person one reputation point, and costs you ten rep points (auto-regulation to prevent abuse).  Here\'s the URL that fully explains how their system works:\r\n[url]http://stackoverflow.com/questions/130654/how-does-reputation-work-on-stackoverflow[/url]\r\nand here\'s my technical notes on what I was thinking of doing with this idea: \r\n[quote]CMS - Reputation System\r\n\r\n1 - Create a global reputation system\r\n\r\n2 - The management of the reputation system allows one to set a title, priority, point value, English name, and deactivated level.\r\n\r\n3 - Create a reputation table with the above values (in #2) \r\n\r\n4 - Reputation is read from the DB into a hash branch in the $FORM hash. \r\n\r\n5 - Reputation values are used to determine function activity. \r\n\r\n6 - Reputation should be played into the forums, commenting, and other features as\r\nnecessary.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[*]Remove the daily and total upload limits for all accounts.  Restrict, instead, how many uploads are visible in the Recent Uploads page dependent upon the account level.  (History note:  Artwork uploads were restricted in the past because the Recent Upload page became innundated with uploads, usually by a singular person, uploading items such as scribbles from the margins of their math test, or images with comments such as \"I don\'t know why I\'m uploading this because I hate it, but here it is.\"  The upload limit was intended to encourage self-regulation of quality of artwork; fewer uploads = upload your best stuff.  This appears to have backfired on us in a very significant way.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[*]Add in other social networking-type features, such as journalling, friends-lists, friends-list-only uploads that don\'t play into any kind of limits and are exempt from rules, and a main user-page that summerizes site activity: private messages, last 5 site uploads, last X uploads in the user\'s Museum, last X journal entries in friends list, etc.\r\n\r\n[*]Social networking features will be secondary, and found off of secondary pages (such as Profile) and Account Management pages.  Visitors to the site should not be introduced to a person\'s gallery through a muddled, crouded summary screen of everything by and about that person.\r\n\r\n[*]Embeddable image and gallery \"banners\" to advertise the person\'s gallery or specific images, all tagged with the S7 logo in some unobtrusive way, and linked back to the site.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n-- Jason',1,'2010-04-01 11:49:43','2010-04-01 11:49:43',0,'72.60.160.217 - 72-60-160-217.pools.spcsdns.net',NULL),

And, as streamlined as v4 is over v3 of S7, I still feel it\'s clunky in places.  v4.1 is aimed to fix a lot of that.  It is my design philosophy that at least 75% of the most-used features should be no more than 3 clicks away.  I think I reached that goal with v4.  However, that doesn\'t mean it\'s necessarily intuitive or easy to find.  Hell, look at some of the latest changes Facebook has made to their UI to see an example of that.\r\n\r\nI\'m fairly new to the AJAX scene as far as technology goes, so I know v4.1 won\'t have a slick, application-like feel such as anything Google puts out.  But, I\'m working towards that kind of UI as a goal.  I just have a lot of learning to do before we get there.  In the meantime, however, we can make the interface cleaner, and keep it intuitive and easy-to-use.  Perhaps when v4.1 is approaching readiness, we can call upon our users to form a small test group to give their input.  Maybe that can be a perk of higher karma/reputation ratings or something.  ::shrug::\r\n\r\n-- Jason',1,'2010-04-01 21:41:27','2010-04-01 21:42:57',1,'71.163.189.45',NULL),

I\'ll say this, though, in Epic Chess Game, while the pose is static, Spock does have a bit more of a natural look to him.  Do you see?  The slight slouch gives him a lot of personality and emotion.\r\n\r\nDo you draw skeletons for your characters before defining them?  I have a bad habit of not doing that, but I\'ve found that when you do a quick stick figure, you can more easily stretch or curve the lines to give the basic pose more fluidity, and then building up the character based on that outline will help make the pose more dynamic.  Some creative exaggeration in your lines can also help the character jump off the page, though this is harder to pull off.\r\n\r\n[url=http://thejinx.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/blaine.jpg]Here\'s[/url] a fairly recent example of an experiment I did trying to make a more dynamic pose as well.  The anatomy isn\'t perfect, but you can see my underlying skeleton, with more exaggerated curves and a bit of perspective toying.  It resulted, I think, in a character with more movement, even in a static pose.\r\n\r\nI think one other issue, at least in Anna Brown and Mr. Charisma, is that your characters aren\'t quite balanced in their poses.  This is something else that drawing a quick skeleton can help you with.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.',1,'2010-04-07 21:27:36','2010-04-07 21:27:36',0,'70.30.11.37 - bas3-malton22-1176374053.dsl.bell.ca',NULL),

(4402,316,17451,'','I\'ve always done stick figures for my drawings, with basic spine, hip, shoulder, and limb lines, a head-sphere, and sometimes joint-spheres if I feel like I need them; I then draw the \"filled skin\" naked body straight over the stick figure, so I can make sure the clothes lie on the body correctly (but if the body itself is flawed, well...).\r\n\r\nI\'ve been working lately on doing more complete mannequin skeletons before I put on the skin, with jawbones, pelvic bones, realistically-shaped collarbones (as opposed to the straight shoulder line), and rib cages that have depth (as opposed to assuming everything aligns perfectly with the spine). I\'ve been fussing with musculature a lot too, since one of the specific critiques I got was that I should pay more attention to the underlying structure that causes/supports the surface of my drawings, i.e. the stuff that lies beneath the skin and clothes, how that connects to the core skeleton, and how it influences the shape of the skin \"shell\". I\'ve also been focusing more on making sure the skeleton itself is proportionate, so I can be good right from the start.\r\n\r\nEpic Chess Game is probably the best example in my gallery, IMO, of my problems with anatomy. Spock\'s posture is very expressive, but if you were to strip him of his uniform and then skin and then muscles, you\'d find problems at every level. His neck is way too long, his waist looks pinched, his shoulders are either too narrow or their perspective is all wrong, he has polygon-mittens for hands, etc. Meanwhile, Data\'s sitting up stiff as a board (even though his posture is always very straight, he\'s rarely *that* stiff), his arms are disproportionate, his legs are uneven, and his chest is turned at an angle that must be uncomfortable even for a robot - the pose isn\'t natural at all. These are the kinds of structural problems I feel I need to address.\r\n\r\nI\'d like to hear more about what you mean, Jinx, about Anna Brown and Mr. Charisma\'s poses being unbalanced. I do have trouble making my chracters seem grounded, which stems from my laziness with drawing backgrounds and, well, ground.\r\n\r\n...Did any of that make sense?

I\'ve had very little formal art training as well, and it made perfect sense.\r\n\r\nI guess the issue here is whether the focus is on anatomy or on dynamic figures; while there\'s overlap, it seems at the moment that you\'re more concerned about just getting the anatomy right.  It also sounds like you\'re on the right track for learning about that, and there isn\'t much I can add in that regard. (My knowledge of anatomy is pretty limited myself.)\r\n\r\nAs for the unbalanced look, it\'s not so obvious with Mr. Charisma, but in Anna Brown, when you compare the shoulders to the hips and feet, she seems to be leaning backwards.  The rest of her pose doesn\'t really suggest the same thing, especially with her legs.  I will also say that her arms are a bit long, and the comparison of her upper and lower right arm makes her upper arm look a little stretched.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a pretty basic tip, but one thing you can try to help balance your characters out better is to flip the image horizontally, or hold the page up to a light and look through the back.  Getting that different perspective on a drawing can help you pinpoint errors that are often hard to see otherwise.',1,'2010-04-12 20:08:23','2010-04-12 20:08:23',0,'70.30.2.215 - bas3-malton22-1176371927.dsl.bell.ca',NULL),

This being especially noticeable in the star trek epic chess piece.\r\nImproving your understanding of the figure\'s construction could help here. Working on visualizing the figure in three dimensions.  Buying one of those little wood art mannequin guys might help here.\r\nDon\'t worry so much about detailed anatomy & muscles right away. Practice what you can with constructing the figure in three dimensions, good a example of what I\'m talking about comes from my own work here:\r\n\r\n[i]take a look at the cube men on this page.[/i]\r\n[url]http://silver-labrador.deviantart.com/art/Life-Drawing-1-152953038[\\url]\r\n[i]and the guy\'s constructed of cylinders in this one.[/i]\r\n[url]http://silver-labrador.deviantart.com/art/Life-Drawing-2-156113635[/url]\r\n\r\nAlso becoming familiar with the [url=http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w317/BlackDracon/villpu_major-markers-anatomy.jpg] Major markers of anatomy[/url], will lend ever more life and credibility to your humanoid figure drawing.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I could recommend is experiment with gesture drawing as an underling skeleton to your drawing instead of the stick figure approach. This is the one thing that held me back when it came to drawing any kind of humanoid figure.\r\nHehe just check out my archived side 7 gallery and you\'ll see some of the same flaws ^-^\r\nExamples of gestures that I\'ve done are on the same links mentioned above, the drawing\'s on the very top were 2 to 3 minute gesture drawings of live models.\r\nIt\'s just one way to get the overall movement and feeling of the drawing on paper, with less focus on detail and accuracy.

I would start with a basic outline/synopsis of the story; not too concrete to give the characters room to evolve as they will, but enough of an idea so I\'d know where the story was going.  Then I\'d write the comic as a script, focusing on visuals and telling the story through dialogue and images.  From there I\'d draw thumbnail sketches for each page to get an idea of layout before doing the final drawing at full size.  I also learned a good tip from a comic artist once to letter the text as one of the first steps in the process, even if you plan to do the text digitally, so that you leave enough room for it on the page and don\'t cover up anything important in the drawings.

Seeing previews of it has given me the urge to play through OOT again. I hope SS has a similar level of depth and, to use Tim Rogers\' terms because I\'ve been obsessively reading everything he\'s written for Kotaku recently, friction. Oh! Here! Here\'s a little Zelda rambling that I did on another site re: [url=http://kotaku.com/5558166/in-praise-of-sticky-friction]this article[/url].\r\n\r\n[quote]I suppose it really is the way you have to engage each and every enemy psychologically that makes OOT the bestest game ever IMO. Stalfos make you feel tense and alert; you can\'t just bash away or you\'re gonna get your ass beat; you have to watch them and read their moves and wait, not boredly but on a hair trigger, for them to give you an opening. Dark Link, quadruplely so (if you don\'t use the Megaton Hammer, which I still think is cheating). Even in the fishing pond, you feel like you have to employ a certain level of finesse in how you angle your fishing rod, just so, so that the fish loses a little ground (er, water) in its fight against you. You have to stand in just the right spot, preferably behind a rock while wearing your Iron Boots so you can brace your feet, to get at certain fish, and even if you can reach them, standing in certain relative spots makes it much harder to reel them in. These subtle differences in angle and stance have huge effects on your ability to land them; it\'s attention to detail, a.k.a. sticky friction, on an absurd level. Don\'t even get me started on the Sinking Lure or the mythical Hylian Loach. I\'ve caught the Loach. Twice. I genuinely feel like that makes me a hero.\r\n\r\nTP lacked this stickiness. I\'ve never been able to put my finger on just why I couldn\'t get into TP the same way I can with OOT, but I think this is it. Enemies, even stalfos, give me a certain sense of smug superiority because they\'re just so easy to mow through; I don\'t have to engage them to kill them (darknuts and iron knuckles, [i]maybe[/i]). It\'s satisfying in a different way, but less so, and after a while it just feels empty. I actually get bored in the fishing pond because the fish just aren\'t as engaging; all you have to do is hold the Reel button, let go when it jumps (and this addition of timed button-releasing adds absolutely nothing to the engagingness), you catch a fish, whoop-dee-doo. In OOT, I can literally spend weeks (Hyrule time) in the fishing pond, because the fish really feel like they\'re fighting for their lives, and the subtle finesse you have to use to catch them makes you feel like you\'ve really achieved something when you succeed at catching one. They feel hard to pull in - not necessarily difficult, but responsive and, well, heavy - in a way that TP\'s fish don\'t. In TP, I push myself to waste a whole day and night in the pond, cute attendant or not. But sometimes, I\'ll load up OOT just to fish.[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\nI\'m also totally excited for the 3DS. As an aspiring game developer myself, the potential camera controls alone make me happy in my pants.\r\n\r\n[size=8](Edited because I fail at formatting.

This was a tonne of work, truth be told.  Most of it, you probably won\'t even notice as the majority of the work had to do with rebuilding some of the back-end of the site.  What that means, though, is better optimization of the back end code, database, and database queries to improve site response times and to prepare for upcoming site features.\r\n\r\nTo highlight some of what you [i]will[/i] notice in this update:\r\n[list][*]Profile Journals\r\n[*]Profile Links\r\n[*]Invite-A-Friend system (earns you 25 Account Credits per friend who signs up)\r\n[*]Lots of bug fixes and performance fixes for the site\'s forums\r\n[*]A few other minor features, and a tonne of back-end stuff\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nCheck out the [url=http://www.side7.com/side7.cgim?template=change_history]change history page[/url] for all the details.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, you might notice that a few of the touted features of v4.1 aren\'t listed above.  That\'s on purpose.  The development schedule had become so out of scope that I decided to defer some features to a quick update (v4.1.1) upon which I can now concentrate.  Hell, the forums bug fixes took several weeks on their own, and required so much in the way of database changes and code changes that it\'s almost a whole new animal.\r\n\r\nSo, I hope you enjoy the new features, and are looking forward to the next update.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n-- BK',1,'2010-11-08 08:41:02','2010-11-08 08:41:02',0,'204.194.77.3 - pm2-users.caci.com',NULL),

Students are often faced with problems in balancing between school, social life, and sometimes having to maintain a job. This is also the point when students choose to buy essay from companies that employ esteemed academic writers that specialize on the needs of students. Whether you need term papers, a research paper, a case study, a dissertation, professional writers who write in specialized fields can accomplish your school work with much ease.\r\n	If you want to buy essay, you can do, just go to [url=http://www.essay-service.org/]essay service[/url]  online. so but you have to be careful about the company you choose as many have been known to deliver poor quality work. A sign that a company is committed to bring you good service is if you can contact them and you have a clear communication channel with the writer. Once you place your order and you want to make sure that your term paper or research paper is going how you want it too, you can work hand in hand with the writer. The writer can send you daily updates on how your assignment is coming along. With this kind of setup, you can give the writer instructions if he is doing it correctly. If you are not satisfied with what the writer has provided, you can have the writer revise the work at no extra charges.\r\n	\r\n',1,'2011-03-04 15:26:17','2011-03-04 15:26:54',1,'122.49.210.50',NULL),

(4700,355,2,'Side 7\'s Next Evolutionary Steps','So, I\'ve started the process of redesigning the site from the ground up.  The site as it stands is very much \"old school\", and is in a web format that is becoming more and more antiquated and abandoned.  And, by abandoned, I don\'t just mean web designers.  I mean web users and visitors, too.  Slick interfaces, AJAX, and other features that no longer require the complete reloading of pages are the draw, and honestly, rightfully so.  Also, social media has taken a strong hold and has fast become the way in which we as a society prefer to deal with our interactions on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo that end, I\'m working on a re-envisioning of Side 7.  The focus of both the way in which we run the site and the site\'s design will always be about the art; art first, supported by the artist community.  But, with that said, we can change the way in which we present those features, and give users easier and more intuitive ways in which to interact, share, and participate on the site.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of the current features will remain, although some of them may evolve to a more efficient or design-compatible format.  All of the data and uploads will also remain and be migrated to the new format.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things that I\'m hoping to be able to do with this reformat, and to be honest, I hope it breathes new life into the site.  I am under no illusions that Side 7 will ever be as big as other art sites, nor do I expect that it will ever have the funding or support that they have.  However, I made a promise a long time ago that if even only one person still finds value in the site, I would continue to maintain it.  Right now, that number can be counted on a singular hand.  And, the site is back to a one-person crew, me.  But, maybe this effort will rebuild the attractiveness of the site, and the sense of community and interaction that it once had.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo that end, I\'m taking a page out of the book used by many an MMO: micro-transactions.  Side 7\'s account structure is changing.  Here\'s a very rough, basic run-down on how things will work:\r\n\r\nNon-basic features on Side 7 will be available for acquisition for a certain amount of Account Credits (whose name might be changing, I haven\'t decided).  Once acquired via Account Credits, the feature is available to your account forever.  Free accounts (1 Star) will have access to the basic features, only. \r\n\r\n\r\n5 Star accounts will become monthly subscription accounts that gain access to every feature on the site, instantly. But those accounts don\'t \"own\" the features.  As long as the 5 Star subscription is maintained, full access is maintained.  If a 5 Star account runs out, it\'ll convert to a 3 Star account, which will basically be a 1 Star account with a small set up added features included.  That account will never drop back down to a 1 Star account.  Any features that weren\'t acquired through Account Credits, or through the 3 Star account, however will no longer be available until acquired or a 5 Star account subscription is renewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope that\'s not confusing.  But, it works for MMOs, and there are a lot of business models surrounding that structure that will make things easier and more affordable for users.  Why buy features you\'ll never use?  Get just the ones you care about, for a far smaller fee than a subscription, and not worry about continual payments.  Also, this gives us the ability to run specials and discounts on certain features frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\nEither way, this is a big project.  I have a project plan in place, and if I can work on it steadily (probably unlikely, between 3 kids, school and work (when I find it again)), will likely take 6-9 months to get the first phase launched.  I\'m still looking for a reliable, dedicated Perl programmer who I would be able to delegate some of the work to.  I do need that help.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour comments and questions are welcome.  I invite any feedback on this.  As always, I can be reached via Instant Messenger: (AIM) armitige3, (Yahoo! IM) badkarmas7, e-mail: badkarma /@/ side7 /./ com, and via the Side 7 forums and private messages.',1,'2011-07-29 14:27:08','2011-07-29 14:27:08',0,'173.66.95.13 - pool-173-66-95-13.washdc.fios.verizon.net',NULL),

(4702,355,17451,'','... I don\'t mean to sound like an ass, but I don\'t really see (unless you\'re working on other things that you\'re not telling us ^^; ) how this is a microtransaction model and not a subscription model.\r\n\r\nThis is a spiffy idea, don\'t get me wrong, but I think the model you\'re talking about is more like, 1-star accounts have 2 uploads per day, but can buy additional uploads for $0.10 each to use whenever (that day, if they want), or can buy a pack of 12 extra uploads to use any time for like $1.00 and get a slight discount. Or they can pay for a month of 5-star access and have unlimited uploads for that month.\r\n\r\nMaybe there could be other individual paid features too, like uploads are by default reduced to 1024x1024, but you can pay $0.25 to have your pic upload at full res. Another $0.25 will add a Download button, so people who, say, want to use your image as a wallpaper can contact you within the site and you can send them a copy, again within the site, instead of having to broker the permission and transaction via email. $0.10 might buy images listed for sale a spot in a special Print Gallery, a separate part of the site that makes it easier to find art that\'s for sale and contact the artists about purchasing it. Best of all, allow people to buy a package of account credits so they don\'t have to whip out the credit card or PayPal every time they want to purchase something (kind of like Microsoft Points).\r\n\r\nSince 5-star accounts would get all this for free, it\'d also be useful to track the average number of each type of microtransaction per month, then make the cost of a 5-star account slightly less than the total of all the averages, so above-average purchasers will find it worthwhile and below-average purchasers can stick to getting one thing at a time.\r\n\r\nAll these examples and prices are just examples (suggestions?), of course; I don\'t know how much server space we have to support this kind of stuff or how drastically you want to change the site\'s business model. But when you mention paying for only the features you want, this is more like what I think of.',1,'2011-07-29 21:08:35','2011-07-29 21:10:37',1,'71.37.152.8 - 71-37-152-8.albq.qwest.net',NULL),
(4703,355,2,'','Hi Navi,\r\n\r\nYou\'re misunderstanding the micro-transaction model.\r\n\r\nLet me try to re-explain:\r\n\r\nSay you have a 1 Star account.  That account gets all the basic features by default.  But, say you wanted the Account Backup feature as well, so that you can back up all of your uploads, received comments, etc.  For a one-time Account Credit fee (and you will still be able to earn Account Credits through site interaction, or buy bulk Account Credit bundles), you can add the Account Backup feature to your account.  Once you buy it, it\'ll be a part of your account forever, no matter if you end up upgrading to a 5 Star account and then are downgraded to a 3 Star account, or if you stay a 1 Star account forever.\r\n\r\nThings like upload extensions (extra image uploads) would be done in increments, and once an extension is bought, it will always apply.\r\n\r\nA 5 Star account is a subscription that takes a 1 Star account, and grants access to all features so long as the 5 Star subscription continues.  No need to earn up Account Credits or buy them to add features; they\'re all available immediately, but the account doesn\'t \"own\" the features.  Some people prefer it that way.  It\'s a matter of immediate satisfaction VS saving up and permanently adding features.  Time VS money.\r\n\r\nDoes that help answer your concerns?\r\n\r\n-- BK',1,'2011-07-30 13:58:43','2011-07-30 13:58:43',0,'173.66.95.13 - pool-173-66-95-13.washdc.fios.verizon.net',NULL),

Not sure what\'s up, but you\'ve got something in your account that\'s really balling up the thumbnail generation code but I don\'t know what, yet.  Long-duration image generation is a function that will be improved with the new hardware, certainly, but that problem has other intrinsic issues that need to be resolved.  I\'ll be implementing something that loads images in batches or incrementally in v5, so that it\'s not having this issue.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I\'m going to put together a utility that, on the back-end, generates your thumbnails and you shouldn\'t have the loading issue anymore.\r\n\r\n-- BK',1,'2011-10-07 15:13:58','2011-10-07 15:13:58',0,'69.241.110.20 - fbr.reston.va.neto-iss.comcast.net',NULL),

The internet was right, it was awesome. =D I can\'t wait to get it on Blu-Ray either.\r\n\r\nHaven\'t seen anything else lately, that was the first movie I saw in the theatre since... um... Clash of the Titans, I think. (I guess there\'s been a sequel since then? I don\'t even know most movies coming out anymore.) I wanted to see John Carter and The Hunger Games earlier this year, but with a now one-year-old it\'s not easy getting out to the movies.',1,'2012-08-14 11:36:06','2012-08-14 11:36:06',0,'64.231.146.42',NULL),
(4878,471,2,'State of the Site Report','Side 7 has been very quiet lately, both from its user-base and its management.  I\'ve been exceptionally busy, and unfortunately Side 7 has been pushed to the wayside as a result.  Family, full-time work, and almost full-time school has dominated my time, and I have not been able to find the time to dedicate to Side 7.  My numerous calls for anyone who knows Perl programming and is willing to help out on the site have met with deafening silence.  Side 7 remains a one-man show.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, I am not closing the site.  Instead, I\'ve been learning new technologies and programming languages.  I\'ve been working on a complete redesign of the site from the ground up, using a whole new programming language and framework.  I will be working with someone who does UI design and development to help create a more modern and streamlined interface to the site.\r\n\r\nUsing the new framework and programming language, development overall should be quicker and easier to modify, and the resulting code should be more robust, easier to manage, and faster.\r\nWhen the site is complete, all current accounts will be migrated, and all currently uploaded assets, comments, etc. will be maintained and carried over.  I will be restructuring how accounts work; there will continue to be free accounts, but the site will be moving to a micro-transactions model (similar to how some free-to-play MMOs operate, such as \"Dungeons and Dragons Online\" or \"Star Trek Online\").\r\n\r\nI will also be adding a tonne of new features:\r\n[list][*]Removal of most account upload limits\r\n[*]New upload types (music, prose, potentially videos)\r\n[*]Social-media styled features\r\n[*]Truly implemented friends groups\r\n[*]Interest groups (Want to start a group about your favorite anime?)\r\n[*]Better implementation and use for account credits (this has been a long-time coming)\r\n[*]Brand new server hardware (it\'s here and in the middle of being configured)\r\n[*]And a lot more.[/list]\r\n\r\nThis is no small task, and I refuse to put a time limit or deadline on it.  I currently am not working full-time, but I am seeking freelance work to bring in money.  Paying my bills (including the co-location and domain registration bills for Side 7) comes first, unfortunately.  So, work will be done as I have the time to do it.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that my ability to get to things such as e-mails to the Admin account, and basic user account requests, is limited and will be slow.  It also means that I won\'t be fixing anything short of a major security issue on the current site.  If I\'m going to get the new Side 7 done and launched, I need to focus on that.\r\n\r\nWe will have open Beta Testing of the new site, as well as early-adopter programs that will give your account bonuses.  More details on that as things progress, but expect a major revival effort.  As much as this is an effort to make the site more appealing to existing members, this is an even larger effort to garner interest from a new generation of members.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you will stick with Side 7 through this, and give the new site a try when it\'s done or in Beta.  And, as always, if there is anything you think I can do that would improve things, let me know.  I can be reached via e-mail (badkarma [at] side7 [dot] com), or AIM (armitige3).  E-mails to the webmaster or admin accounts are currently taking a lower priority.\r\n',1,'2012-08-16 11:55:34','2012-08-16 11:55:34',0,'68.50.26.161 - c-68-50-26-161.hsd1.va.comcast.net',NULL),

This is a good thing, as v4.x is definitely showing its age, as is the hardware that v4.x runs upon.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of v5 is occurring on the new server hardware that as purchased for Side 7 by the very kind [url=http://hosting.gushi.org]Gushi[/url], who has served as a full-time, and now occasional, admin of the site and the site\'s hardware since the late 1990s.  The new hardware is pretty zippy, and the new site is being written in Ruby on Rails (all previous versions of Side 7 were run through Perl).\r\n\r\nWith this version I\'m being much, much more deliberate in the design, and subsequently the design documentation.  There is so much going into this upcoming version of the site, so much is changing, and the code is being written from scratch from the ground-up, that by-the-seat-of-my-pants programming would be extremely detrimental to the efforts.\r\n\r\nThe past couple of weeks have been spent doing a lot of research into database design principles and discussing ideas with colleagues of mine who are seasoned database administrators.  I\'ve received a lot of insight into how I want to design certain aspects of the site and the underlying database.  Also, the data models used for the User accounts have been very carefully redesigned to optimize everything.  Ruby on Rails gives me a lot of capability for dealing with the data and how everything relates without requiring tonnes of coding overhead.  This is a definite boost over the way things were done in Perl.\r\n\r\nThe User model is nearly complete.  After that, the data models for user Content, commenting, forums, and other common aspects of the site will be created.  Once I\'m done designing and implementing the data models for each portion of the site, then the wireframes which determine how the site will look shall be completed.  Those wireframes will be posted to our Facebook page (did you know we had a Facebook page?  You\'ll find it [url=http://www.facebook.com/Side7]here[/url]) and your comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nOnce the wireframes are done, then the nitty-gritty of building the Controllers that make the site work, along with the Views that render the website\'s screens, will be done.  At that point, we\'ll be looking for [b]Beta Testers[/b]!  If you\'re interested, you can post to Side 7\'s Facebook page about your interest!\r\n\r\nWell, that\'s where we stand, and what I\'m planning.
